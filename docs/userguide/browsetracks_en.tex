\section{BrowseTracks}\label{sec:browsetracks}

BrowseTracker is a plugin that helps navigating between recently opened files in \codeblocks. The list of recent files is saved in a history. The number of entries is limited to 20. With the menu \menu{View,Browse Tracker,Clear} the history is cleared.

With the window \samp{Browsed Tabs} you can navigate between the items of the recently opened files using the menu entry \menu{View,Browse Tacker,forward/backward} or the shortcut Alt-Left/Alt-Right.

A common procedure when developing software is to struggle with a set of functions which are implemented in different files. The BrowseTracks plugin will help you solve this problem by showing you the order in which the files were selected. You can then comfortably navigate the function calls.

The configuration of the plugin is stored in your application data directory in the file \file{default.conf}. If you use the personality feature of \codeblocks the configuration is read from the file \file{\var{personality}.conf}.
