		<title>About Code::Blocks</title>
		<para>Code::Blocks is an open-source cross-platform IDE (Integrated Development Environment). Code::Blocks is designed with flexibility in mind, most of its features are provided by external modules (plugins) making it easily extendable and configurable.</para>
		<para>Code::Blocks is oriented towards C/C++, so the official supported compilers are all C/C++ compilers (including GNU GCC, MingW GCC, Microsofts Visual C++ Free Toolkit 2003), but there are already people who are using Code::Blocks for other programming languages (like D and Fortran). This is only possible because Code::Blocks makes use of a compiler framework, which could handle several compilers.</para>
