Code::Blocks Documentation Conversion Tools Installation Instructions

After downloading the sources of the documentation, there are some things that
need to be set up on your computer if you want to convert the XML source into
something easier to read (eg. HTML). If you are interested in this, then keep 
reading. You only need this when you want to recreate the docs youreself.


If you want to convert the XML to HTML, install the following:

* libxml2
  - libxml2
* libxslt
  - libxslt1.1
* DocBook DTD
  - docbook-xml
* DocBook XSL Stylesheets
  - docbook-xsl
  
To create the documentation, you can simply run make in the directory of the
documentation you want. For example, when you want to create the documentation guide
type the following:

	cd docguide
	make
