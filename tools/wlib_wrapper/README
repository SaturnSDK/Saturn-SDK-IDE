This is a simple wrapper for wlib.exe of OpenWatcom compiler.

IF YOU 'RE NOT USING OPENWATCOM, STOP READING. THIS IS NOT FOR YOU.

wlib.exe general syntax is "wlib.exe lib_name.lib +obj1.obj +obj2.obj ..."
Currently, Code::Blocks can't add the plus (+) sign in front of every object file. Until this is possible, you can use this wrapper as linker for static libraries.

Copy this wrapper to the same dir wlib.exe resides.
