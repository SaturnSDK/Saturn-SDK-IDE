codeblocks (1.0svn5297) unstable; urgency=low

  * Nightly linux build
  * package- and directory-structure overworked:
    moved plugins from /usr/share/codeblocks to /usr/lib/codeblocks,
    split off a codeblocks-common-package, that includes
    architecture independent files
  * changes to make lintian run without errors on sources and *.deb-files
  * no further patches of mine, they are all in svn now 
  * the svn-log can be found in /usr/share/doc/codeblocks/changelog.gz
