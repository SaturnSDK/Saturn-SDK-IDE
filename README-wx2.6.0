Now that wxWidgets-2.6.0 is released, work has begun to port Code::Blocks to work with it.
Officialy, Code::Blocks still uses wxWidgets-2.4.2, until all issues from porting it to wxWidgets-2.6.0  are resolved.

KNOWN ISSUES
------------
Win32: MDI client window is not behaving correctly when maximized (initially, by code)

HOWTO build wxWidgets-2.6.0 for use with Code::Blocks
------------------------------------------------------
This process requires that you have MinGW installed. MSYS is *not* needed.
Download and decompress the wxWidgets-2.6.0 source distribution. For the rest of this small HOWTO, C:\wx2.6.0 will be assumed to be the directory wxWidgets-2.6.0 exists in.
Open a command prompt and type the following:

cd C:\wx2.6.0\build\msw
mingw32-make -f makefile.gcc BUILD=release SHARED=1 MONOLITHIC=1 USE_XRC=1 UNICODE=0 VENDOR=cb
cd ..\..\contrib\build\stc
mingw32-make -f makefile.gcc BUILD=release SHARED=1 MONOLITHIC=1 USE_XRC=1 UNICODE=0 VENDOR=cb

If all has gone well, the necessary libs and DLLs will exist in C:\wx2.6.0\lib\gcc_dll.
Copy the DLLs somewhere in your path (c:\windows\system32 is a good choice).
Open CodeBlocks-wx2.6.0.cbp with Code::Blocks and add the following search dirs:

Compiler:
C:\wx2.6.0\include
C:\wx2.6.0\contrib\include

Linker:
C:\wx2.6.0\lib\gcc_dll

Resource compiler:
C:\wx2.6.0\include

Now hit "Compile".
That's it!
Now, fix that MDI window bug ;)

REMARKS:
- If all goes well and you build Code::Blocks with wx2.6.0, but when you launch it it crashes, delete all plugins and hit "Compile" again (it will only link the plugins).
- Different object files output dirs are used for building Code::Blocks with wx2.6.0, so you can have Code::Blocks work with either wxWidgets version (2.4.2 or 2.6.0) independently.

If you have any problems, post them in the Development forum at http://www.codeblocks.org/index.php?name=PNphpBB2&file=viewforum&f=7

Yiannis.
