	* Updated XP-style-manifest location in win32 resource file

2005-04-21 16:13  mandrav

	* Fixed bug in search function

2005-04-21 10:49  mandrav

2005-04-20 16:17  mandrav

	* Bug-fix in .vcproj importer: compiler search dirs
	* Bug-fix in .dsp importer: no compiler options imported some times

	* Pinpointed loading bottleneck in cbproject.cpp (Added TODO item)

2005-04-20 11:56  mandrav

	* Fixed ToDo list not refreshing (bug #1185950)

2005-04-20 11:25  mandrav

	* When a file of unknown type is opened, the MIME handler plugins
	  are asked to open it.

2005-04-20 10:48  mandrav

	* Speed-up project loading times (broken by my last commit about
	  the"unnamed-new-files" bug)

2005-04-20 05:34  rickg22

	* Skipped the base path calculation if the project is still loading
	  (now does it at the end of ProjectLoader::DoUnits). Still works as
	  usual when adding the files manually.

2005-04-19 16:20  mandrav

	* Don't default to "search in selected text" for searches, when the
	  selected text is the result of the previous search (rfe #1144178)

2005-04-19 16:07  mandrav

	* Display "text not found" message if the search failed (rfe
	  #1143936)

	  by update.bat from the setup directory)

2005-04-17 17:14  rickg22

	* 	Fixed typo library in the wxwindows_static.cbp

2005-04-17 04:29  rickg22

	* Added missing manifest file for XP styles in repository

2005-04-16 20:26  mandrav

	* Updated unix project file and Makefile.unix
	* Updated some #includes to work in linux (quotes used instead of
	  angled braces)

2005-04-15  mandrav

	* Fixed generated Makefile to correctly create needed dirs for
	  objects and dependencies output
	* Fixed project tree to contain "clean" paths (folders). No more
	  ".." folders ;)
	* Fixed objects and dependencies output to behave correctly even for
	  relative files in dirs above the project file's dir

2005-04-15  rickg22

	* Disabled Project menus (even popup menus) when Project hasn't
	  finished loading.
	* Replaced annoying "Project files are still being loaded"
	  wxMessageBox() with a much more friendly wxBell().
	* Fixed crash in MainFrame::OnProjectCloseProject (a "return;" was
	  missing inside the "if").

2005-04-14  mandrav

	* Added ChooseDirectory() function in globals.cpp - use this if you
	  want a dir selector dialog
	* Because of the above, absolute paths are now possible where a path
	  is entered (like compiler dirs, working directory, etc)
	* Replaced all calls to other dir selector dialogs to use the new
	  ChooseDirectory()

2005-04-14  mandrav

	* Bug-fix that, upon "Run", would try to locate the executable in
	  the working dir.

2005-04-14  mandrav

	* Removed calls to wxSafeYield() which disabled input and made the
	  program slower (at least appeared to be)
	* Updated project file options dialog to support multiple build
	  targets. Contribution by Tim Baker (patch #1182707)

2005-04-14  rickg22

	  seem to be slow

2005-04-13  mandrav

	* Added "working dir" build target property (used for program
	  execution)
	* Updated code-completion's intelligence to look inside namespaces
	  for unknown tokens

2005-04-13  mandrav

	* Fixed MSVS7 importer to correctly detect .vcproj version and
	  adjust importing accordingly

2005-04-13  mandrav

	* Updated unix project file and Makefile.unix

2005-04-13  mandrav

	* Updated win32 Makefile

2005-04-13  mandrav

2005-04-12  mandrav

	* Fixed search directories re-ordering in compiler options (bug
	  #1181038)

2005-04-12  mandrav

	* Global compile options (compiler/linker dirs/options) are now put
	  after the project options (bug #1180420)

2005-04-10  mandrav

	* Updated "about" dialog (contributors part) and contact email

2005-04-10  mandrav

	* Updated dependencies generation for direct-mode, using Tim Baker's
	  patches (#1179956 and #1179950). Changes offer a huge speed increase
	  and there is no need for individual .depend files anymore. One
	  dependency file per-project is used now to cache the file
	  dependencies. The per-target dependency output directory setting is
	  now used only for "make-mode" compiling.

2005-04-10  mandrav

	* Added separate setting for resource compiler dirs
	* Re-arranged the compiler options dialog: merged the compiler and
	  linker dirs and added resource dirs, all in one page

	  session has been requested (bug #1180013)
	* Updated win32 Makefile and project

2005-04-10  rickg22

	* 	+ Added maintenance comments and CVS ID tags to directcommands.cpp

2005-04-10  rickg22

	* 	+ Added "self" parameter to wxSafeYield for messagemanager (this
	  should allow *in theory* changing tabs. In practice it doesn't work,
	  but doesn't harm either so i'm leaving it like that) + Added user
	  friendly error message to the debugger in case the default debugger
	  is not set up.
	* Fixed display glitch in the Compiler Settings dialog (xrc).

2005-04-10  rickg22

	* 	To do items for beta 1.8 and above

2005-04-09  rickg22

	* Fixed "ugly DDE error" bug (TODO: Add a button in settings to "Set
	  File associations now")

2005-04-09  mandrav

	* Removed from CVS the obsolete .dsp files. They were old and
	  unmaintained and they were cluttering the base dir.

2005-04-08  mandrav

	* Updated project file with the latest fixes about commands-only
	  targets

2005-04-08  mandrav

	* Fixed filename issue with commands-only targets (bug #1178232)

2005-04-08  mandrav

	* Improved templates handling in class-parser

2005-04-08  rickg22

	* Sped up (a little) project/workspace loading (less flicker, etc)
	* Added new parameter to EditorManager::Open to speed up project
	  loading (doesn't search for projectfile data anymore, since we
	  already have it)

2005-04-08  rickg22

	* Replaced all occurrences of wxYield() with wxSafeYield().
	  wxYield() is _NOT_ safe for critical operations and may lead to
	  unexpected crashes.

2005-04-07  mandrav

	* Minor update to class browser to display "jump to implementation"
	  only where appropriate.
	* Added union support in class-parser
	* Fixed handling of nameless structs (f.e. used in unions) in
	  class-parser

2005-04-07  mandrav

	* Added "jump to implementation" class-parser functionality for the
	  symbols tab - Needs testing.

2005-04-07  mandrav

	* Fixed class-parser handling of multiple var declarations on a
	  single line, e.g. "int x,y,z;" (bug #1162313)

2005-04-07  mandrav

	* Both single and double-click on a compiler error, jumps to the
	  error line (bug #1178104)

2005-04-07  mandrav

	* Fixed handling of unnamed enums in class-parser
	* Corrected line number calculation for class-parser tokens (used in
	  "jump to declaration")

	* 	+ Added managed thread class for later use.

2005-04-07  rickg22

	* 	Added managed thread class for future reimplementation of
	  parserthread (WARNING: Not tested yet)

2005-04-07  mandrav

	  #1177988)
	* Added setup file for the full package (codeblocks + mingw)

	  configuration (RFE #1175452)

2005-04-05  mandrav

	  (RFE #1174716)

2005-04-05  rickg22

	  "clean".

2005-04-05  rickg22

	* Removed output filename "codeblocks.cbp" from non-compilable
	  targets. (TODO: Need to find out how it was added there in the first
	  place)

	* Fixed bug in Editor Tree when renaming files
	* Cleaned up code in Editor Tree stuff (editormanager)

2005-03-31  mandrav

2005-03-27  rickg22

	* Fixed bug 1167913 (cancel button on close misbehavior)

2005-03-27  rickg22

	* Fixed bug #1167913 (Save project cancel button doesn't work).
	* Also, modified the workspace/project/files closing process. Before
	  closing ANYTHING, it checks EVERYTHING for modifications and asks
	  user to save. This way, if the user presses "cancel", the state of
	  the workspace is not modified at all.

2005-03-26  rickg22

	* 	"Cancel" button on close now works when project is modified. However
	  this is a temporary fix (see notes)

2005-03-26  rickg22

	* 	+ Added auxiliary menu and toolbar functions in Manager class
	* Heavy modifications to PluginManager: 99% of the code has been
	  moved from main.cpp + Added transitional code so the plugins can
	  later use a data-driven menu system
	* moved aboutplugin dialog to SDK

2005-03-26  rickg22

	* Minor aesthetic update (hides splash screen before showing main
	  window)
