<li><h5>The Best C++ IDE</h5>

  I've been searching a lot for a good C IDE, but I think CodeBlocks is the best even if it's not complete yet.
</p>
<p>
  <b><span class="withhints" title="Some free IDE written in Delphi">[the competition]</span></b> is almost at version <b><span class="withhints" title="5">[censored]</span></b>, but it contains many bugs and it cannot handle simple tasks like selecting a text and dragging it to a new location for example.
</p>
<p>
  So my compliments to you, your IDE is it only at version1 beta, but i like it better than <b>[the competition]</b>, I think that CodeBlocks is really competitive.

<p>I've tried many IDE's including Dev C++, and CodeBlocks is the best IDE of all, it's very friendly and its compatibility with the suported compilers (at least with VC++ 2003) is excellent.</p>
<p>Before downloading I didn't expect it to be as good as the other IDEs, but CodeBlocks really surprised me and turned to be better than the others...</p>
<p>Keep up the GREAT work!</p>

  It works! <img src="/img/icon_eek.gif" alt=":shock:" width="15" height="15" />
</p>
<p>
  And has workspaces too! Your project needs more exposure. I had been looking for a usable IDE for like 2 years; ever since I set my MSVC6 CD on fire after one Internal Compiler Error too many. Eclipse didn't do it for me. Bloodshed's DEV-CPP came closer but no workspaces...<br />
  Looks like this is it. OpenGL works...
</p>
<p>
  Congrats!

<p>Beta6 full setup is so great, what a relief to no longer need the huge MinGW
download<b>*</b>, this is so much neater, runs right out of the box.</p>

<div class="section"><p>I wanted an ordinary IDE without fancy stuff.<br />
And to use it with Free Visual Toolkit.<br />
This is great for fast prototyping coding.<br />
Thank you.</p></div>

  Hi. I recently downloaded Code::Blocks and just wanted to say it's great. I
  switched over from DevC++ (been using it for awhile) and had no issue at all,
  my app just built and I was able to start working straight off the bat.
</p>

<p>Looking forward to download the SDK and develop some plug-ins :D<br />
Thanks again.</p>

<p>I've used MinGW-Studio and Dev-Cpp for years now but Code::Blocks (in my opinion) does it much better. Switching my projects to CB was very simple.</p>
<p>
  I even tried to compile CB from CVS. The readme states 2 steps (wxWidgets related and CB itself). It worked from scratch - that easy! I've never seen such a cool (and open) IDE. Keep it up!
