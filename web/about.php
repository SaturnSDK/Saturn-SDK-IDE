<h5>Bio:</h5>
<p>Born in 1975, programmer since 12 (his first projects were small games for
a bulletin board system). In 1993 he entered the <a rel="external" href="http://www.unam.mx/">Universidad Nacional Autonoma
de Mexico</a>, and joined the independent student research group <a href="http://www.grupolinda.org/" rel="external">LINDA</a>, where he
researched about Artificial Intelligence and data compression. In 2001, he began
studying PHP and XML, where he learned the concept of <em>multi-tier</em> programming.</p>

<h5>How he joined:</h5>
<p>I was a regular Dev-C++ user. I had used it for some time, and
recently had tested its spinoff wx-devcpp by Guru Kathiresan. Around 2004, I
thought that a C++ IDE should be written in C++ (and not in Delphi), so I began
thinking on the idea of a cross-platform IDE. After researching on various free IDE's,
I found Code::Blocks and joined in the beginnings of 2005 to help debug and implement
one or two features. Since then, I've been using Code::Blocks and never regretted it! :)</p>

Role: Plugins developer</b></p>
<h5>Bio:</h5>
<p>
  He was born in Pereira and has been living there for 22 years. He's currently
  studying System and Computing Engineering in the UTP (<a href="http://www.utp.edu.co/">Universidad Tecnológica
  de Pereira</a>).
</p>

<p>
  He has mainly focused in C and C++ and also some Python (Compiler's project @
  college). Some libraries he has worked with are Allegro and wxWidgets.
</p>

<h5>How he joined the project:</h5>
<p>
  I was looking for a nice C/C++ IDE for several months and couldn't find
  anything so I always had to stick with my current IDE and its bugs. Every now
  and then I retried but always had the same bad luck. Then I found Code::Blocks.
</p>

<p>
  My contributions have been bugfixes to bugs I've found, the ASTyle plugin update and currently the help plugin maintenance.<br />
  Now I'm in because of the help plugin :D
