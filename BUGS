Bugs that need immediate attention:
-----------------------------------
* Wrong windres command-line when invoked from within the IDE (works when called manually through an exported Makefile)
* [DONE 7/5/2004]: Debugger does not work if target's filename has spaces
* [DONE 7/5/2004]: "Compile all" does not re-create the new makefile (I guess), so it doesn't work
* [DONE 19/3/2004]: Problem with editor settings:
	a) if visited once then visited again, it crashes
	b) if visited once, then after you open a couple of files (or use F11), some time it looses the highlighting information...
  Something is definitely wrong with EditorColorSet class.
* [DONE 17/3/2004]: Handle spaces in project file. Spaces are replaced by '\ ' and something goes wrong. Every time the project is saved, one mor '\' is added...
* [DONE 17/3/2004]: Handle newlines in project file. Replaces them with '\\n' on save and back to '\n' on load, but it doesn't seem to work right all the time...
* [DONE 17/3/2004]: Remove case-conversion in UnixFilename() but make sure everything works as expected (like no multiple editors for the same file)...
* Handle on-the-fly plugins enabling/disabling (works) to not mess-up the interface (menus/toolbars)
* If a plugin is disabled, it breaks the event processing chain...
    Now, the plugin manager sends the event only to the last plugin. It might process it or not and then
    it "travels" up the chain of plugins. If one plugin (say in the middle) is disabled, it's not processing
    events and so the event "travelling" stops. The rest of the plugins never hear about this event.
    One solution is that plugin manager checks for disabled plugins and posts the event not only to the
    last plugin but also to all plugins that are followed by a disabled plugin (skipping the chain-breakers that is)...
    Pseudo-code:
        bool sendevt = true
        for(last-plugin to first-plugin) // reverse iteration
        {
            if (!plugin->active)
                sendevt = true // notify next plugin
            else
            {
                plugin->notify
                sendevt = false // don't notify next plugin
            }
        }
* Work on existing plugins enabling/disabling
