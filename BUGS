Bugs that need immediate attention:
-----------------------------------
* Handle on-the-fly plugins enabling/disabling (works) to not mess-up the interface (menus/toolbars)
* If a plugin is disabled, it breaks the event processing chain...
    Now, the plugin manager sends the event only to the last plugin. It might process it or not and then
    it "travels" up the chain of plugins. If one plugin (say in the middle) is disabled, it's not processing
    events and so the event "travelling" stops. The rest of the plugins never hear about this event.
    One solution is that plugin manager checks for disabled plugins and posts the event not only to the
    last plugin but also to all plugins that are followed by a disabled plugin (skipping the chain-breakers that is)...
    Pseudo-code:
        bool sendevt = true
        for(last-plugin to first-plugin) // reverse iteration
        {
            if (!plugin->active)
                sendevt = true // notify next plugin
            else
            {
                plugin->notify
                sendevt = false // don't notify next plugin
            }
        }
* Work on existing plugins enabling/disabling
