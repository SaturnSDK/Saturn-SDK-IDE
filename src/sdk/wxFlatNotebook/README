+ Notebook style now uses wxWindowBase flag rather then keeping its own member, this allows applying regular style (e.g. wxSIMPLE_BORDER) to the notebook
+ wxFNB_TABS_BORDER_SIMPLE was added and now replacing the wxFNB_BORDER - this flag draw a gentle border around the page container
+ When no tabs in the notebook, the background colour is now set to wxSYS_COLOUR_APPWORKSPACE - this gives more MDI look and feel on Windows
