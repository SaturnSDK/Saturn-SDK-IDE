+ Buttons (Left, Right, X) now has nice effects when pressed, hover, clicked

+ Notebook style now uses wxWindowBase flag rather then keeping its own member, this allows applying regular style (e.g. wxSIMPLE_BORDER) to the notebook
+ wxFNB_TABS_BORDER_SIMPLE was added and now replacing the wxFNB_BORDER - this flag draw a gentle border around the page container
+ When no tabs in the notebook, the background colour is now set to wxSYS_COLOUR_APPWORKSPACE - this gives more MDI look and feel on Windows

  The new style has the following features

	Note: that the new tab DOES NOT support 'X' button on the tab

========================================================
Version 2.0 
========================================================

 - Code refactoring: 
   + remove wxStyledNotebook class, the same functionality now exist under wxFlatNotebook
   + All drawing was moved to renderers (wxFlatNotebook.cpp file is now cleaned from drawing)
   + Now using smart_ptr & singleton template classes where ever possible
   
 - Added smart tabbing style with new and easy way to select tabs (request #1527285)
   Once this style is enabled, pressing Ctrl+[Shift]+T will popup a dialog with all the open tabs, another Ctrl+[Shift]+T will run throw the 
   dialog list, until the Ctrl key is released.
   
 - Added new styles:
   wxFNB_SMART_TABS - which enables the above feature
   wxFNB_DROPDOWN_TABS_LIST - which replaces the '<>' (left, right arrows buttons) with a drop down list (popup menu) with all the open tabs
   this feature is similar to VS8 tabs styles.
   
- Fixed a bug in SetSelection - in case that the navigation buttons were hidden, and the selection was not visible, it did not ensure that it will be visible

Have fun !
