Version 1.2 Updated at: 1/25/2006 11:11PM
======================================================

Fixed following bugs / features were added:

+ Tested on Linux (Fedora Core 4) - makefile is now provided !
+ Fixed bug that causes focus lost when using tab+ctrl
+ Added a style to disable the drag and drop 
+ Flickering of buttons was reduced significally
+ Buttons (Left, Right, X) now has nice effects when pressed, hover, clicked
+ Buttons area is now used better - when hiding buttons, more place is left for drawing tabs
+ Notebook style now uses wxWindowBase flag rather then keeping its own member, this allows applying regular style (e.g. wxSIMPLE_BORDER) to the notebook
+ wxFNB_TABS_BORDER_SIMPLE was added and now replacing the wxFNB_BORDER - this flag draw a gentle border around the page container
+ When no tabs in the notebook, the background colour is now set to wxSYS_COLOUR_APPWORKSPACE - this gives more MDI look and feel on Windows
+ Fixed tabs drawing glitches - more space between the images and the text and the tab borders
+ Code clean up - especially the OnPaint() function

Fixed following bugs / features were added:

Features:

+ New event is now fired after page is being closed wxEVT_COMMAND_FLATNOTEBOOK_PAGE_CLOSED - 
  this allow the application to preform some cleanup after closure of page
+ An option to disable a tab - a tab can now be disabled, which means it will not receive any event, user can not select 
  it nor navigate to it (using Ctrl+Tab/Tab)
  
  
Bugs:

======================================================
Version 1.5  9/13/2006 7:40PM
======================================================

Features:

+ New style added - VC8 style, with curved tabs 
  The new style has the following features
	- Background of tab area can be painted in gradient
	- Colourful tabs - a random gentle colour is generated for each new tab (very cool :))
	
	Note: that the new tab DOES NOT support 'X' button on the tab

+ Build for DLL debug/release was fixed (on windows)
+ Makefile for Linux is now more generic using wx-config tool
+ Several drawing issues were fixed
+ Tabs now has an extra line that separate them from the page

========================================================
Version 2.0 
========================================================

 - Code refactoring: 
   + remove wxStyledNotebook class, the same functionality now exist under wxFlatNotebook
   + All drawing was moved to renderers (wxFlatNotebook.cpp file is now cleaned from drawing)
   + Now using smart_ptr & singleton template classes where ever possible
   
 - Added smart tabbing style with new and easy way to select tabs (request #1527285)
   Once this style is enabled, pressing Ctrl+[Shift]+T will popup a dialog with all the open tabs, another Ctrl+[Shift]+T will run throw the 
   dialog list, until the Ctrl key is released.
   
 - Added new styles:
   wxFNB_SMART_TABS - which enables the above feature
   wxFNB_DROPDOWN_TABS_LIST - which replaces the '<>' (left, right arrows buttons) with a drop down list (popup menu) with all the open tabs
   this feature is similar to VS8 tabs styles.
   
- Fixed a bug in SetSelection - in case that the navigation buttons were hidden, and the selection was not visible, it did not ensure that it will be visible

========================================================
Version 2.1
========================================================

This version is released shortly after 2.0 since v2.0 contained many code changes, I expected feedback from user
which came ... (as expected)

So, the following changes fixes applies to v2.1:

- 'x' button on tabs with VS8 style
- dropping page on foreign notebook that does not have image list, while the page does have caused a crash 
- Drawing problems with VS71 & Fancy style when selecting the bottoms tabs
- DeletePage, RemovePage now accepts second argument to allow user to disable page closing events
- Page changing events are now fired from SetSelection, to fix a problem where only mouse left click allowed users to handle the page changes event (e.g. Ctrl + T did not fire page changes event ... )
- If no right click menu is provided, an event wxEVT_COMMAND_FLATNOTEBOOK_CONTEXT_MENU is fired (a bug that existed preveneted this event to be fired)
- wxFNB_ALLOW_FOREIGN_DND style added (check the demo)
- All xpm files are now located on a single resource file
- the smart tabbing dialog icon, was replaced from PNG to XPM.


Have fun !
