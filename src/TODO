This list is far from complete, but here it goes...

Stuff that should be implemented easily:
-------------------------------------
* Add ProjectManager configuration dialog (things like OpenLastProjectOnStartup, etc)

Stuff that need thought before implementing:
--------------------------------------------
* Make Makefile targets "clean", "install" etc, configurable by user
* Configure compiler options by platform (or/and release/debug configurations)
