    <p class="noindent"><strong>Artistic Style</strong> is a source code <strong>indenter</strong>,
    <strong>formatter</strong>, and <strong>beautifier</strong> for the <strong>C, C++, C#</strong>
    and <strong>Java</strong> programming languages.</p>

    <p class="noindent">When indenting source code, we as programmers have a tendency to use both
    <strong>spaces</strong> and <strong>tab</strong> characters to create the wanted indentation.
    Moreover, some editors by default insert spaces instead of tabs when pressing the tab key, and
    other editors (Emacs for example) have the ability to "pretty up" lines by automatically
    setting up the white space before the code on the line, possibly inserting spaces in a code
    that up to now used only tabs for indentation.</p>

    <p class="noindent">Since the <strong>NUMBER</strong> of space characters showed on screen for each tab
    character in the source code changes between editors (unless the user sets up the number to his
    liking...), <strong>one of the standard problems programmers are facing when moving from one
    editor to another</strong> is that code containing both spaces and tabs that was up to now
    perfectly indented, suddenly becomes a mess to look at when changing to another editor. Even if
    you as a programmer take care to <strong>ONLY</strong> use spaces or tabs, looking at other
    people's source code can still be problematic.</p>

    <p class="noindent">To address this problem, Artistic Style was created - a filter written in
    <strong>C++</strong> that automatically re-indents and re-formats C / C++ / C# / Java source
    files. It can be used from a <strong>command line</strong>, or it can be <strong>incorporated
    as classes</strong> in another C++ program.</p>

    <h3><a href="astyle.html">Documentation</a></h3>

    <p>There is complete documentation for using Artistic Style. Most documentation is included in
    the distribution package.</p>

    <h3><a href="news.html">News</a> and <a href="notes.html">Release Notes</a></h3>

    <p>
        Information on the changes in the current release. The News contains information
        on major changes and how they might affect the use of Artistic Style. The Release
        Notes contains a list of all changes made to the program. Information on old releases
        is also listed. &nbsp;</p>

    <h3><a href="download.html">Download</a></h3>

    <p>Download the latest release from the SourceForge 
    <a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=2319">file releases page</a>. Or get the
        current development version from the Subverson repository.</p>

    <h3><a href="install.html">Install Information</a></h3>

    <p>Information on compiling and installing Artistic Style. The Windows and OpenVMS platforms
    come with a precompiled executable. Other platforms must compile the project. Follow the
    instructions for the appropriate platform (Linux, Mac, OpenVMS, or Windows).</p>

    <h3><a href="license.html">License</a></h3>

    <p>Artistic Style may be used and distributed under version 3 the 
    <a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl.html"><b>GNU Lesser General Public
    License</b></a> (LGPL). The LGPL is a set of additional permissions added to 
        version 3 of the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html">GNU General Public License</a>.
        You can use Artistic Style in free or commercial software without charge. Projects that
    use Artistic Style do not have to make the source code available. If Artistic Style
    itself is modified, however, the modified Artistic Style source code must be made
    available.</p>

    <h3><a href="scripts.html">Scripts</a></h3>

    <p>This page contains scripts to support the Artistic Style program. They are in various
        script languages
        and work on different platforms. It includes scripts to clean the
        directories of backup files created by Artistic Style.</p>

    <h3><a href="links.html">Links</a></h3>

    <p>There are several applications that use Artistic Style as contributed software. It is either
    embedded in the application or called as a command line program. The
        applications include Graphical User Interfaces to view the effect of formatting
        on the source code, development environments for various platforms, and other software.&nbsp;</p>

    <h3><a href="http://astyle.sourceforge.net/develop/">Developer Information</a></h3>

    <p>Artistic Style has compile options for creating a shared library (DLL) or static library for
    use with a Graphical User Interface (GUI). With the Java Development Kit (JDK) installed it can be compiled as
        a Java Native Interface (JNI) and called from a Java program. The Developer Information documents the calling
    procedure and has example programs for C++, Java, and C#.</p>

    <h3>Bug Reports, Change Requests, Notification</h3>

    <p>Bug reports and change requests should be submitted to the
    <a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=2319&amp;atid=102319">bug tracker page</a>.
    It is best to log in to SourceForge before submitting a report so you can be contacted if
    necessary. Note that code copied and pasted into the bug report <strong>will not be
    indented</strong> after the data is submitted. You must indicate the indentation when you
    submit the request (e.g. replace leading spaces with periods).</p>

    <p>Notification of new releases is activated from the
    <a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=2319">file releases page</a>. In
    the Latest File Releases section at the top of the page, Notes<b>/</b>Monitor column,
    click on the envelope. You will receive notification when a new release is available.</p>
