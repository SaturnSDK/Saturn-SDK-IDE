    <p><strong>Artistic Style</strong> is a source code <strong>indenter</strong>, <strong>formatter</strong>, 
    and <strong>beautifier</strong> 
    for the <strong>C, C++, C#</strong> and <strong>Java</strong> programming 
    languages.</p>
    <p>When indenting source code, we as programmers have a tendency to use both
    <strong>spaces</strong> and <strong>tab</strong> characters to create the 
    wanted indentation. Moreover, some editors by default insert spaces instead 
    of tabs when pressing the tab key, and other editors (Emacs for example) 
    have the ability to &quot;pretty up&quot; lines by automatically setting up the white 
    space before the code on the line, possibly inserting spaces in a code that 
    up to now used only tabs for indentation. </p>
    
    <p>Since the <strong>NUMBER</strong> of space characters showed on screen 
    for each tab character in the source code changes between editors (unless 
    the user sets up the number to his liking...), <strong>one of the standard 
    problems programmers are facing when moving from one editor to another
    </strong>is that code containing both spaces and tabs that was up to now 
    perfectly indented, suddenly becomes a mess to look at when changing to 
    another editor. Even if you as a programmer take care to <strong>ONLY</strong> 
    use spaces or tabs, looking at other people's source code can still be 
    problematic. </p>
    
    <p>To address this problem, Artistic Style was created - a filter written in
    <strong>C++</strong> that automatically re-indents and re-formats C / C++ / 
    C# / Java source files. It can be used from a <strong>command line</strong>, 
    or it can be <strong>incorporated as classes</strong> in another C++ 
    program. </p>

    <p>Artistic Style may be used and distributed under the
    <b>GNU Lesser General Public License</b> (LGPL). You can 
	use it for free or commercial software without charge. Projects that use Artistic Style do not 
	have to make the their source code available. If Artistic 
	Style itself is modified, however, the modified Artistic Style source code 
	must be made available.</p>
	
	<h3><a href="astyle.html">Documentation</a></h3>
     <p>There is complete documentation for using Artistic Style. Most 
		documentation is included in the distribution package.</p>
	
    <h3><a href="astyle_news.html">News</a> and
    <a href="astyle_notes.html">Release Notes</a></h3>
    <p>Changes in this release include improved array formatting, brackets that 
    attach and detach from comments, keywords assigned by file type, 
	new preserve-dates (-Z) option, change in Linux bracket formatting for 
    header files, support for the OpenVMS compiler, and many important bug fixes.</p>
	
	<h3><a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=2319l">Download</a></h3>
    <p>Download the latest release from the file releases page. 
    The latest release is indicated by the line with a green 
    background. Get the file for the appropriate platform (Linux, Mac, OpenVMS, 
    or Windows).
    Extract the compressed package and copy it to a 
    work folder. Then follow the install instructions for the appropriate platform 
	as described in the install information.</p>
	
    <h3><a href="install.html">Install Information</a></h3>
    <p>Information on compiling and installing Artistic Style. The Windows 
	and OpenVMS platforms come with a precompiled executable. Other platforms must compile 
	the project.
    Follow the instructions for the appropriate platform (Linux, Mac, OpenVMS, or 
	Windows).</p>
    
	<h3><a href="http://astyle.sourceforge.net/develop.html">Developer Information</a></h3>
	<p>Artistic Style has compile options for creating a shared library (DLL) or 
	static library for use with a Graphical User 
	Interface (GUI). See the Developer Information for the calling 
	procedure and other details. The following &quot;Links&quot; section has a sample 
	program that uses the interface. </p>
	
    <h3><a href="astyleX.html">Supplemental Documentation</a></h3>
    <p>There are some formatting problems with <code><nobr>--break-blocks</nobr></code> (or
    <code><nobr>--break-blocks=all</nobr></code>).</p>
    
    <h3>Bug Reports, Change Requests, Notification</h3>
    <p>Bug reports and change requests should submitted to the
    <a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=2319&atid=102319">bug 
    tracker page</a>. It is best to log in to SourceForge before submitting a 
    report so you can be contacted if necessary. Note that code copied and 
    pasted into the bug report <strong>will not be indented</strong> after the 
    data is submitted. You must indicate the indentation when you submit the 
    request (e.g. replace leading spaces with periods).</p>
    <p>Notification of new releases is activated from the
    <a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=2319">file 
    releases page</a>. In Latest File Releases, under Notes / Monitor, click on 
    the envelope. You will receive notification when a new release is available.</p>

	title="open new window">Artistic Style for Windows</a> is a sample GUI program for Windows.  
	It uses an unmodified Artistic Style 
	program compiled for a GUI. The source code needs some work so the source is not available 
	for now. It should work under Linux using WINE. Future enhancements and 
	platform support will depend on the response to the sample program.</p>
	<p><a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/universalindent" target="_blank"
	title="open new window">UniversalIndentGui</a> is a cross platform GUI for 
	several code formatters. 
	The main feature is a live preview to show how the selected formatting 
	options affect the source code. This allows review and testing of the 
    various options before formatting a file. It can be used with a sample file or with 
	your actual source code. It is a good way to try out the options from 
	various indentation programs.</p>
	<p>For Mac users there is a 
	<a href="http://assortedgeekery.com/archives/2005/03/22/reindenting-c-in-textwrangler-and-bbedit-using-astyle" 
	target="_blank" title="open new window">script</a> for 
	&quot;Reindenting C In TextWrangler and BBEdit Using Astyle&quot;. Selected text from 
	the editor can be passed to Artistic Style and replaced with the reformatted 
	text. Simply highlight the text you would like to reindent, choose the 
	script from the shebang (<code>#!</code>) menu, and the text will 
	immaculately formatted.</p>
