    <p><strong>Artistic Style</strong> is a source code <strong>indenter</strong>,
    <strong>formatter</strong>, and <strong>beautifier</strong> for the <strong>C, C++, C#</strong>
    and <strong>Java</strong> programming languages.</p>

    <p>When indenting source code, we as programmers have a tendency to use both
    <strong>spaces</strong> and <strong>tab</strong> characters to create the wanted indentation.
    Moreover, some editors by default insert spaces instead of tabs when pressing the tab key, and
    other editors (Emacs for example) have the ability to "pretty up" lines by automatically
    setting up the white space before the code on the line, possibly inserting spaces in a code
    that up to now used only tabs for indentation.</p>

    <p>Since the <strong>NUMBER</strong> of space characters showed on screen for each tab
    character in the source code changes between editors (unless the user sets up the number to his
    liking...), <strong>one of the standard problems programmers are facing when moving from one
    editor to another</strong> is that code containing both spaces and tabs that was up to now
    perfectly indented, suddenly becomes a mess to look at when changing to another editor. Even if
    you as a programmer take care to <strong>ONLY</strong> use spaces or tabs, looking at other
    people's source code can still be problematic.</p>

    <p>To address this problem, Artistic Style was created - a filter written in
    <strong>C++</strong> that automatically re-indents and re-formats C / C++ / C# / Java source
    files. It can be used from a <strong>command line</strong>, or it can be <strong>incorporated
    as classes</strong> in another C++ program.</p>

    <h3><a href="astyle.html">Documentation</a></h3>

    <p>There is complete documentation for using Artistic Style. Most documentation is included in
    the distribution package.</p>

    <h3><a href="news.html">News</a> and <a href="notes.html">Release Notes</a></h3>

    <p>Changes in this release include improved file handling, recursive processing, a Java Native
    Interface, a new backup script, and many important bug fixes. Developers using Artistic
    Style in another project should be aware that there are two new functions that have
    been added to the ASStreamIterator class.</p>

    <h3><a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=2319l">Download</a></h3>

    <p>Download the latest release from the file releases page. Get the file for the appropriate
    platform (Linux, Mac, OpenVMS, or Windows). Extract the compressed package and copy it to a
    work folder. Then follow the install instructions for the appropriate platform as described in
    the Install Information.</p>

    <h3><a href="install.html">Install Information</a></h3>

    <p>Information on compiling and installing Artistic Style. The Windows and OpenVMS platforms
    come with a precompiled executable. Other platforms must compile the project. Follow the
    instructions for the appropriate platform (Linux, Mac, OpenVMS, or Windows).</p>

    <h3><a href="license.html">License</a></h3>

    <p>Artistic Style may be used and distributed under the <b>GNU Lesser General Public
    License</b> (LGPL), version 2.1. You can use it in free or commercial software without charge. Projects that
    use Artistic Style do not have to make the source code available. If Artistic Style
    itself is modified, however, the modified Artistic Style source code must be made
    available.</p>

    <h3 id="_Scripts">Scripts</h3>

    <blockquote>
        <p>
        <a href="http://downloads.sourceforge.net/astyle/astyle-clean-sh_1.0.gz" 
        target="download"
        title="open download window">astyle-clean.sh</a>
        is a <strong>Linux shell script</strong> to clean a directory tree by moving Artistic Style
        backup files to a separate directory. This allows Artistic Style to create backup files
        without cluttering your source directories. There are four variables at the start of the
        script that need to be set for each application. The script will move or copy backup files
        to a backup directory maintaining the original directory structure. New backup files will
        be copied over the old so you will always have the most current backup.</p>

        <p>
        <a href="http://downloads.sourceforge.net/astyle/astyle-clean-bat_1.0.zip" 
        target="download" 
        title="open download window">astyle-clean.bat</a>
        is a <strong>Windows batch file</strong> to clean a directory tree by moving Artistic Style
        backup files to a separate directory. This allows Artistic Style to create backup files
        without cluttering your source directories. There are four variables at the start of the
        script that need to be set for each application. The script will move or copy backup files
        to a backup directory maintaining the original directory structure. New backup files will
        be copied over the old so you will always have the most current backup.</p>

        <p>
        <a href="http://downloads.sourceforge.net/astyle/astyle-pl_1.0.gz"
        target="download" 
        title="open download window">astyle.pl</a> is a
           <strong>Mac Perl script</strong> to reindent source files in TextWrangler and BBEdit using Artistic Style.
            Selected text
           from the editor can be passed to Artistic Style and replaced with the reformatted text.
            Save the script in the "Unix Filters" directory (you need to restart TextWrangler to see new scripts).
            Then simply highlight the text you would like to reindent, choose the script from the Shebang
           (<code>#!</code>) menu, and the text will be immaculately formatted. You can add Artistic Style options to the "my $astyle"
            line in the script.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <h3><a href="links.html">Links</a></h3>

    <p>There are several applications that use Artistic Style as contributed software. It is either
    embedded in the application or called as a command line program.</p>

    <h3><a href="astyleX.html">Supplemental Documentation</a></h3>

    <p>There are some formatting problems with <code>--break&#8209;blocks</code> (or
    <code>--break&#8209;blocks=all</code>).</p>

    <h3><a href="http://astyle.sourceforge.net/develop/">Developer Information</a></h3>

    <p>Artistic Style has compile options for creating a shared library (DLL) or static library for
    use with a Graphical User Interface (GUI). With the Java Development Kit (JDK) installed it can be compiled as
        a Java Native Interface (JNI) and called from a Java program. The Developer Information documents the calling
    procedure and has example programs.</p>

    <h3>Bug Reports, Change Requests, Notification</h3>

    <p>Bug reports and change requests should be submitted to the
    <a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=2319&amp;atid=102319">bug tracker page</a>.
    It is best to log in to SourceForge before submitting a report so you can be contacted if
    necessary. Note that code copied and pasted into the bug report <strong>will not be
    indented</strong> after the data is submitted. You must indicate the indentation when you
    submit the request (e.g. replace leading spaces with periods).</p>

    <p>Notification of new releases is activated from the
    <a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=2319">file releases page</a>. In
    the Latest File Releases section at the top of the page, Notes<b>/</b>Monitor column,
    click on the envelope. You will receive notification when a new release is available.</p>
