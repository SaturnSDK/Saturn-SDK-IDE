    <h3>
        Artistic Style 1.25&nbsp; (pending)</h3>

    <p>
        With a new Artistic Style release some unchanged source files will be formatted because of changes to Artistic
        Style. You may want to format your source before making program changes in order to bring it up to date.</p>
    <p>
        There has been an important change to the &#8209;&#8209;min&#8209;conditional&#8209;indent option. Instead of
        using the number of spaces it now uses a code expressed in number of indents. If you are using the default setting
        of two indents, or a setting of zero indents, there is no change. Otherwise, check the documentation for the new codes.</p>
    <p>
        The --style=linux has been changed to always use a minimum conditional indent of one-half the indent length. This
        is in the style definition and cannot be changed. If you do not want this setting use the K&amp;R style instead.
    </p>

    <h4>
        Developers</h4>

    <p>
        On the library build of Artistic Style, the second argument of the fpError typedef and the javaErrorHandler declaration
        has been changed from "char*" to "const char*". This could cause a compile error if not changed in your source
        statements.</p>
    <p>
        There has been a change in the &#8209;&#8209;min&#8209;conditional&#8209;indent option. Instead of using number
        of spaces to indent it now uses a code expressed in number of indents. In the past this option was a problem because
        it was also affected by changes in indent length. With this release there is &nbsp;only one variable affected.
        The option is not affected by changes in indent length. The option minimum conditional indent length is computed
        automatically by ASFormatter after all the options &nbsp;have been processed. Refer to the code in astyle_main.cpp
        to see how the option is processed.</p>
    <p>
        The --style=linux has been changed to always use a minimum conditional indent of one-half the indent length. The
        option is set in the function fixOptionVariableConflicts.</p>

    <h3>
        Artistic Style 1.24&nbsp; (February 2010)</h3>

    <p>
        With a new Artistic Style release some unchanged source files will be formatted because of changes to Artistic
        Style. You may want to format your source before making program changes in order to bring it up to date.</p>
    <p>
        A new bracket type option, &#8209;&#8209;brackets=horstmann (-g), uses broken brackets and places run-in statements
        on the same line as an opening bracket. This bracket type has about the same vertical compression as attached
        brackets and in addition provides bracket alignment. It is the only style that combines the advantages of saving
        space and aligning brackets. The &quot;Tab and Bracket Options&quot; section in the documentation contains the
        details. To accommodate Hostmann brackets the &quot;none mode&quot; brackets will now allow run-in statements.
        Array formatting has been changed to format run-in statements when required. There have been some general improvements
        to array formatting. The minimum value for spaces per tab was changed from one to two. The example programs in
        the &quot;Developer Information&quot; section have been changed to Horstmann brackets.</p>
    <p>
        Two new options, &#8209;&#8209;add&#8209;brackets (-j) and &#8209;&#8209;add&#8209;one&#8209;line&#8209;brackets
        (-J), will add brackets to unbracketed one line conditional statements. The &#8209;&#8209;add-brackets will add
        the brackets according to the currently requested predefined style or bracket type. If no style or bracket type
        is requested the brackets will be the attached type. The &#8209;&#8209;add&#8209;one&#8209;line&#8209;brackets
        will add the brackets as single line brackets. This option implies &#8209;&#8209;keep&#8209;one&#8209;line&#8209;blocks
        and will not break single line blocks.
    </p>
    <p>
        The above options allow two new predefined styles. Horstmann style, &#8209;&#8209;style=horstmann (-A9), uses
        Horstmann brackets and three spaces per indent. The so called "One True Brace Style", &#8209;&#8209;style=1tbs
        or &#8209;&#8209;style=otbs (-A10), uses linux brackets and the option &#8209;&#8209;add&#8209;brackets. The basic
        criteria for most predefined styles were obtained from the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indent_style">Indent
            Style</a> discussion at Wikipedia. The "Predefined Style Options" section in the documentation contains the
        details.</p>
    <p>
        The spaces per indent can now be changed for any of the predefined styles. In previous releases the option would
        be ignored. This will allow any of the &#8209;&#8209;indent options to be used with a predefined style. If the
        spaces per indent is not specified, the default for the style will be used.</p>
    <p>
        A new option, &#8209;&#8209;pad&#8209;header (&#8209;H), will insert space padding after headers ('if', 'for',
        'while'...). To remove any unwanted current space padding, use the option &#8209;&#8209;unpad&#8209;paren (&#8209;U).
        If both &#8209;&#8209;pad&#8209;header and &#8209;&#8209;unpad&#8209;paren are used, the headers will be padded
        and the padding will be removed from other parens. This has required a change to the default formatting of paren
        headers. They will now be left unchanged instead of automatically inserting space padding, unless the new option
        is requested.</p>
    <p>
        New options --align-pointer=type (-k1), &#8209;&#8209;align&#8209;pointer=middle (-k2), and &#8209;&#8209;align&#8209;pointer=name
        (-k3) will attach a pointer or reference operator (* or &amp;) to either the operator type (left), operator name
        (right), or align it between the type and name. The spacing between the type and name will be preserved, if possible.
        The recognition of pointers and references has been improved. This resulted in an improvement of the &#8209;&#8209;pad&#8209;oper
        (-p) option.</p>
    <p>
        A new option, &#8209;&#8209;indent&#8209;col1&#8209;comments (-Y), will indent C++ comments beginning in column
        one. By default C++ comments beginning in column one are not indented. This option will allow the comments to
        be indented with the code.</p>
    <p>
        New options --lineend=windows&nbsp;(-z1), --lineend=linux&nbsp;(-z2), and --lineend=macold&nbsp;(-z3) will force
        use of the specified line end style. Valid options are windows (CRLF), linux (LF), and macold (CR). MacOld style
        is the format for OS 9 and earlier. Mac OS X uses the Linux style. Changes in line ends will cause the file to
        be updated, even if no other changes occur. If one of these options is not used the line ends will be determined
        automatically from the input file.</p>
    <p>
        Default line end processing has been improved to always output consistent line ends. It will use the line ends
        that are most frequently used in the input.</p>
    <p>
        The Stroustrup predefined style has been changed to use 5 spaces per indent. This is the indentation used in the
        book "The C++ Programming Language" by Bjarne Stroustrup.</p>
    <p>
        The minimum conditional indent for the Linux predefined style has been changed to 4, or one-half the indent-length.
        The previous minimum conditional indent was 16 (2 indents). The new value corresponds to the soft tab in the style
        description at Wikipedia and gives a better conformance to the definition of the style. And it gives a better
        appearance to the continuation lines.</p>
    <p>
        Embedded SQL statements are now formatted correctly. The formatting of the SQL statements will be maintained as
        long as the standard hanging indent format is used. If the "exec sql" statement is indented more than the following
        statements, the SQL will be aligned in a single column.</p>
    <p>
        Assembler statement processing has been improved to include extended assembly and Microsoft specific assembler
        lines and blocks.</p>
    <p>
        The --indent-classes (-C) option has been fixed to indent C++ struct blocks containing access modifiers (public,
        protected, and private). The struct block is not indented if there are no access modifiers in the block.</p>
    <p>
        The formatting for C++ class initializer statements has been changed from two indents to one and an in-statement
        indent added for continuation lines.</p>
    <p>
        The intermediate .tmp file used in formatting has been eliminated and memory is used instead. In most cases this
        should result in a noticeable speed improvement.</p>
    <p>
        Checks for the maximum in-statement indent have been fixed. The indent for some long continuation lines may be
        decreased. If you want the previous indentation, increase the &#8209;&#8209;max&#8209;in&#8209;statement option.</p>
    <p>
        Occasionally, someone will use Artistic Style to format a file encoded with UTF-16 or UTF-32 bit encoding. These
        files contain many nul bytes are incompatible with the 8 bit encoding assumed by Artistic Style. Since this rarely
        happens, Artistic Style has been changed to list these files as "unformatted" and display a warning message. The
        files must have a Byte Order Mark (BOM) for the encoding to be recognized. These files can be changed with the
        program iconv and with some text editors such as SciTE. For more information see the Wikipedia discussion on <a
            href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_Unicode_encodings#Compatibility_issues">Compatibility issues</a>.</p>
    <p>
        The Artistic Style documentation has been changed to include a new "Padding Options" section. The padding options
        were previously in the "Formatting Options" section. This was done to allow space for additional options in GUIs.</p>
    <p>
        The Scripts page has a couple of new scripts, including a "clean" script in python.</p>
    <p>
        There are new configuration and project files for Visual Studio, and additional files for Visual Studio 2010.
        There are instructions in the &quot;Install Information&quot;.</p>
    <p>
        The Intel compiler for Linux, release 11.1, has a new procedure for compiles. Read the new &quot;Install Information&quot;
        before using this compiler release.</p>
    <p>
        There is now a Subversion repository for Artistic Style. A new Subversion web page describes how to check-out
        the files. The source code is under development and some changes take several weeks to complete. And the intermediate
        source files have not been through the extensive system tests that are done before each release. Use reasonable
        precautions when using source code from the repository.</p>
    <p>
        SourceForge recently made changes to their website which caused a few problems. The web page links should be fixed
        with this release. It seems that some bug reports may have been lost. If you have submitted a report that has
        not been addressed please check to be sure it is still there. In addition Yahoo closed their GeoCities site which
        made the AStyleWin programs temporarily unavailable. The new site is <a href="http://jimp03.zxq.net/" target="astyle"
            title="open new window">jimp03.zxq.net/</a>.</p>
    <p>
        The release announcements mailing list was discontinued with the new SourceForge system. There is a new <a href="https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/astyle-announce">
            astyle-announce</a> mailing list that will be used instead. This is a low volume list that will be used for
        new release announcements and notification of important repository commits. Member postings will not be accepted.
        Membership in the old list was not retained so you will need to register for the new list. There is information
        for subscribing on the "Bug Reports, Change Requests, Notification" section of the Home page.</p>

    <h4>
        Developers</h4>

    <p>
        The Artistic Style for Windows program has been updated to support the current release and can be used for an
        example GUI. It will run on Linux under WINE. It is available at <a href="http://jimp03.zxq.net/" target="astyle"
            title="open new window">jimp03.zxq.net</a></p>
    <p>
        The options --lineend=windows&nbsp;(-z1), --lineend=linux&nbsp;(-z2), and --lineend=macold&nbsp;(-z3) apply only
        to the console build. It was not included in the developer builds because developers usually have their own method
        for handling line ends.</p>
    <p>
        The option --break-closing-brackets has been moved from Bracket Options to Formatting Options. It was being mistaken
        for a bracket type, which it is not.</p>
    <p>
        Rejecting a file for&nbsp; UTF-16 or UTF-32 bit encoding apply only to the console build. Some class libraries,
        such as wxWidgets (and probably Qt), have the methods to convert the files to UTF-8. The handling for these types
        of files must be determined by the individual applications.
    </p>
    <p>
        There has been an additional variable, formattingStyle, added to the ASFormatter class. This is now the ONLY option
        that needs to be set to define the style. Setting the individual options is no longer necessary. The individual
        options are now set in the fixOptionVariableConflicts function in ASFormatter. The predefined style options will
        now override all other options. The order of entry does not matter as in previous versions.</p>

    <h3>
        Artistic Style 1.23&nbsp; (February 2009)</h3>

    <p>
        With a new Artistic Style release some unchanged source files will be formatted because of changes to Artistic
        Style. You may want to format your source before making program changes in order to bring it up to date.</p>
    <p>
        In the last few years the names of indent styles have been somewhat standardized. A typical example is the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indent_style">
            Indent Style</a> discussion at Wikipedia. To keep up to date with the industry, changes have been made to
        the names of two of the styles. The ANSI style can now also be Allman or BSD, and for the KR or Java style you
        should now use only Java. The KR style has always been basically the same as the Java style. The KR style is depreciated
        and will be removed sometime in the future.</p>
    <p>
        Four new predefined styles have been added, K&amp;R (with an &amp;), Stroustrup, Whitesmith, and Banner. K&amp;R
        style uses Linux type brackets where the depreciated KR style uses attached brackets. Notice that K&amp;R and
        KR are two different styles. Stroustrup style uses the new stroustrup brackets described below. Whitesmith has
        broken brackets that are indented. Banner has attached brackets that are indented. The following table summarizes
        the changes:</p>

    <center>
        <table>
            <tr><th>old&nbsp;style</th>

    <p>
        &nbsp;</p>
    <p>
        There is a new Stroustrup style and bracket type. It is similar to the Linux bracket type except that the brackets
        are attached to namespaces and classes instead of being broken. It is the style used by Bjarne Stroustrup, the
        founding father of C++, in his book "The C++ Programming Language".</p>
    <p>
        Indenting brackets in the Whitesmith and Banner styles causes a 'hanging indent' with switch statements and C++
        class modifiers (public, private, protected). Microsoft Visual Studio avoids this by giving class and switch blocks
        an extra indent when brackets are broken (Whitesmith style). Gnu Emacs gives switch blocks an extra indent but
        not class blocks. With indented, attached brackets (Banner style), Visual Studio does not use an extra indent
        and Emacs does not have the style. <strong>Artistic Style uses an extra indent for switch blocks and C++ class blocks
            for both Whitesmith and Banner styles.</strong> This provides the best appearance in defining the style. If
        a different format is wanted, use the individual options instead of the predefined style. You can try indent&#8209;brackets,
        indent&#8209;classes, and indent&#8209;swiches on a class or switch block to see the results.</p>
    <p>
        The GNU style and indent&#8209;blocks option have been changed to indent only the blocks within a function body.
        The opening bracket for namespaces and classes is no longer indented. The opening bracket for functions remains
        not indented. This is the same formatting used by the Emacs editor and is in compliance with the GNU standard.
        The GNU style has also been changed to NOT indent namespaces by default. Namespaces can be indented by using the
        indent&#8209;namespaces option. This is consistent with the other predefined style options.</p>
    <p>
        The predefined style options will now override all other options. It does not depend on order of entry as in previous
        versions. Using a predefined style will give that style regardless of other conflicting entries. The predefined
        styles options now define only the bracket placement and sometimes the spaces per tab. This will give users the
        option to define the other details according to their preference. The 'Predefined Style Options' section in the
        documentation contains the details.</p>
    <p>
        Changes have been made to some of the long options. Most configuration files will NOT allow options to have duplicate
        keys (e.g. the Windows registry and wxWidgets). The key is the value before the first '=' sign. If there is no
        &#39;=&#39; sign then the entire option is the key. The options were changed to eliminate duplicate keys when
        more than one option is allowed. The old options are depreciated but will still be valid until at least the next
        release. The short options remain the same. The following options have changed:</p>

            </tr>

        The "else if" statements will now be placed on a single line by default. This is described as a 'fix' since it
        was apparently always supposed to do this. The headers will be broken only if the option 'break&#8209;elseifs'
        is specified. Most users want the statements joined since breaking them requires an extra indent.</p>
    <p>
        The convert&#8209;tabs option has been changed to maintain the correct spacing according to the current tab setting.
        Previously a tab was replaced by a single space. The current option for spaces per tab is used. It may NOT produce
        the expected results if convert&#8209;tabs is used when changing the spaces per tab. The tabs are NOT replaced
        in quotes.</p>
    <p>
        The break&#8209;blocks and break&#8209;blocks=all options have finally been fixed. They will no longer break statements
        following the block and will keep preceding comments with the block. Many other fixes were required for the options
        to work correctly. The "Release Notes" page has the details.</p>
    <p>
        A new delete&#8209;empty&#8209;lines option will delete empty lines within a function or method. If used with
        break&#8209;blocks or break&#8209;blocks=all it will delete all lines EXCEPT the lines added by the break&#8209;blocks
        options.</p>
    <p>
        There is a new 'formatted' (&#8209;Q) option that displays only the files that have been formatted. Files that
        are unchanged are not displayed.</p>
    <p>
        Short options have been added for the predefined styles.</p>
    <p>
        Semi&#8209;colons are now always space padded. All commas are space padded if pad&#8209;oper is used.</p>
    <p>
        The C/C++ keyword 'extern' no longer causes an extra indent.</p>
    <p>
        There have been several important fixes to the indent&#8209;brackets and indent&#8209;blocks options.</p>
    <p>
        There have been several important fixes to C# formatting.</p>
    <p>
        The scripts page has a new Emacs script containing hooks that will set the Emacs style options to the default
        options used by Artistic Style. It also defines a Banner style. It can be used to compare output from the two
        programs. The files will not be exact but it should be reasonably close. If you can improve the Emacs script I
        would like to have the changes.</p>
    <p>
        There are two new projects on the Links page. <a href="http://www.codelite.org/" target="astyle" title="open new window">
            <strong>CodeLite</strong></a> is a C++ development environment with some useful features, including a template
        to generate a test program using the excellent tool UnitTest++. <a href="http://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&sl=de&u=http://www.andre-simon.de/&sa=X&oi=translate&resnum=1&ct=result"
            target="astyle" title="open new window"><strong>Highlight</strong></a> converts source code to formatted text
        with syntax highlighting. It was used it for the source code in the Developer Information section.</p>
    <p>
        I need a Mac OS X user to do testing on new releases. The test usually take 30 minutes at the most. They may need
        to be repeated two or three times depending on the results. Programming knowledge is not necessary but will probably
        be helpful. Reply to the project email address if you would like to volunteer.</p>

        Thanks to Eran Ifrah and Max Horn for their contributions. Travis Robinson wrote the original C# interface program.</p>

    <h4>
        Developers</h4>

    <p>
        There is a new page in the Developer Information that has an example of calling Artistic Style from a C# program.</p>
    <p>
        There was an omission in the peekNextLine function added in the last release which causes it to bypass empty lines.
        If you copied the function into a program, the change is at the end of peekNextLine in astyle_main. The line containing
        the change is marked with comments. Not correcting it may cause an infrequent line break if the option break&#8209;blocks
        or break&#8209;blocks=all is used. The break will occur only if there are empty lines within comment lines that
        precede a header.</p>
    <p>
        There has been an additional variable, formattingStyle, added to the ASFormatter class. This is now the ONLY option
        that needs to be set to define the style. Setting the individual options is no longer necessary. The individual
        options are now set in the fixOptionVariableConflicts function in ASFormatter.</p>
    <p>
        The predefined style options will now override all other options. The order of entry does not matter as in previous
        versions. This will be done even if astyle_main is not used by your system. This was done by moving the checks
        from astyle_main to ASFormatter. The procedure is in the function fixOptionVariableConflicts in ASFormatter.</p>
    <p>
        The predefined style options now define only the bracket placement and sometimes the spaces per tab. This will
        give users the option to define the other details according to their preference. It is best if the other options
        are NOT disabled when a predefined style is selected. All options should be left available to modify the style.
        The conflicts will be resolved by the fixOptionVariableConflicts function which is called after all options have
        been processed. All you need to do is set the options selected by the user.</p>
    <p>
        The Artistic Style for Windows program has been updated to support the current release. It is available at <a href="http://jimp03.zxq.net/">
            jimp03.zxq.net</a></p>
    <p>
        I apologize for the unplanned changes this may add to your system. But Artistic Style is starting to mature as
        an application and the changes are needed to bring it up to date. If you have any questions or problems, email
        me and I will do my best to help you resolve them.</p>
    <p>
        &nbsp;</p>

    <h3>
        Artistic Style 1.22&nbsp; (April 2008)</h3>

    <p>
        This release contains many bug fixes. The emphasis was on formatting fixes for C# files. In the last two releases
        there have been over 80 items removed from the bug report. There have been many more fixes which were not reported
        but were discovered while testing. The new options in this release exposed many unreported formatting problems.
        I will try to fix the ones remaining in the next two or three releases. Some of them will be difficult to fix.
        See the <a href="notes.html#_1.22">Release Notes</a> for a complete list of changes.</p>
    <p>
        Starting with this release, if a file is <b>not</b> changed by Artistic Style a new file and a backup file are
        not created. A "make" will not recompile the unchanged file and it will not be committed to a revision control
        system. A console message will indicate that the file is unchanged. Note that this is different from using the
        &#8209;&#8209;preserve&#8209;date option. This option retains the date on files that <b>have</b> changed. In this
        case the changed files will still be recompiled and committed to revision control. (&#8209;&#8209;preserve&#8209;date
        actually changes the time by one unit).</p>
    <p>
        In the rare case when Artistic Style aborts, the file being formatted will no longer be deleted. This is done
        by using a temporary output file (.tmp). It should now be safe to manually abort Artistic Style and restart at
        any time. The backup of files that were previously formatted will not be replaced.</p>
    <p>
        The console display has been changed. The default now displays one line per file. This will be useful if only
        one file is being formatted, such as when Artistic Style is called from a text editor or development environment.
        A new &#8209;&#8209;verbose (&#8209;v) option will display optional information, such as release number and statistical
        data. A new &#8209;&#8209;quiet (-q) option will suppress all output except error messages. Some short options
        have changed to accommodate the new options. The short option for &#8209;&#8209;version is now -V (old -v) and
        for &#8209;&#8209;convert&#8209;tabs is &#8209;c (old &#8209;V).</p>
    <p>
        A new &#8209;&#8209;recursive (-r, or -R) option will process subdirectories recursively. The filename should
        contain a wildcard (e.g. "$HOME/astyle/src/*.cpp"). Linux users should place the filename in double quotes so
        the shell will not resolve the wildcards. Windows users should <strong>not</strong> include wildcard object files,
        like setargv (Visual C) or wildargs (Borland), in the compiles. Wildcard processing in MinGW was excluded by adding
        "int&nbsp;_CRT_glob&nbsp;=&nbsp;0" as a global variable. (It could also be excluded by linking to CRT_noglob.o).
        Artistic Style now does the wildcard processing internally.</p>
    <p>
        When processing directories recursively it is sometimes necessary to exclude certain files or directories. This
        can be done using a new exclude (&#8209;&#8209;exclude=file&#8209;or&#8209;directory) option. There is no short
        option. Multiple exclude statements are allowed. The <a href="astyle.html#_Other_Options">Other Options</a> section
        of the documentation contains the details.</p>
    <p>
        It is always a good idea to create a backup for files that have been formatted. This can cause a problem in that
        it creates a lot of excess files in your source directories. There are now new script files available that will
        move the files to a backup directory. The original directory structure will be maintained the in the backup. There
        is a batch file for Windows and a shell script for everyone else. They are available in the <a href="scripts.html">
            Scripts</a> section of the home page.</p>
    <p>
        There is a new <a href="links.html">Links</a> page that lists programs using Artistic Style. In general, they
        seem to be good quality software.</p>
    <p>
        If you are using a development environment to compile Artistic Style, be sure to read the <a href="install.html#_Compiler_Options">
            Compiler Options</a> section in the Install Information. In particular, you should define NDEBUG in the Release
        compile to remove the assert statements. There are quite a few of these and they will slow down processing if
        NDEBUG is not used. The assert statements are necessary due to the nature of the program. Also, when reporting
        bugs it is a good idea to log in first. Occasionally, more information is needed on a problem. If the poster did
        not log in there is no way to contact them.</p>
    <p>
        A Java Native Interface has been added for Java developers. This will allow an Artistic Style shared library (DLL)
        to be called from a Java program. A shared library (Dll) using the Java interface can still be called from C,
        C++, or C# programs. There is a sample program in the <a href="http://astyle.sourceforge.net/develop/">Developer Information</a>.</p>
    <p>
        <strong>Developers using Artistic Style in another project</strong> should be aware that there are two new functions
        that have been added to the ASStreamIterator class (peekNextLine() and peekReset()). These will have to be coded
        into source modules which use Artistic Style without astyle_main. In most cases the functions can simply be copied
        without the template information. The assert statements may also be removed. A variable will need to be added
        to the class and another may need to be modified. If the shared or static library configuration is being used
        then no changes are necessary.</p>
    <p>
        The file globing function was obtained from <a href="http://www.codeproject.com/string/wildcmp.asp" target="astyle"
            title="open new window">The Code Project</a> and was written by Jack Handy. It was modified slightly to make
        the comparisons case insensitive for Windows.</p>

    <h3>
        Artistic Style 1.21&nbsp; (June 2007)</h3>

    <p>
        This release contains many bug fixes. Array formatting and indentation has been improved. Arrays and enums are
        now formatted by a different procedure than functions. Brackets will now attach to lines with comments. Brackets
        will be broken from lines with comments without bringing the comments with them. All comments will remain in their
        original column, if possible. The formatting of empty blocks was fixed. The BracketType definition was expanded
        and the bracket types are now correctly identified. There are several formatting fixes for Java files. See the
        <a href="notes.html#_1.21">Release Notes</a> for a complete list of changes.</p>
    <p>
        A new option, --preserve-date (-Z), has been added. This will retain the date modified of the original file in
        the new formatted file. Otherwise the new file will contain the current date.</p>
    <p>
        The option --errors-to-standard-output has been shortened to --errors-to-stdout. The <b>short</b> options -c (mode=c)
        and -j (mode=java) have been removed. The options should seldom be needed since the mode is now set automatically
        from the file extension for <b>each source file</b> instead of for each program execution. A new long option --mode=cs
        (C#) has been added. Key words are now set for each file depending on the file mode (C, Java, or C#). This will
        eliminate formatting problems caused by not being able to identify the source code language.</p>
    <p>
        There has been a change to the Linux style bracket formatting for C++ header files. In the past brackets have
        been broken for function definitions within a class. With this release the brackets will be attached. The brackets
        will also be attached for arrays, structs, enums, and other top level objects that are not classes or functions.
        The Linux style formatting for Java and C# has not been changed.</p>
    <p>
        This release supports only one platform in each distribution package. In the past all platforms were included
        in every package. If you use Artistic Style on more than one platform you will need to download packages for each
        platform. The main difference in platforms is the build directory and the line endings. The source code and documentation
        are the same for all packages.</p>
    <p>
        There are new instructions about optimizing compiler options in the <a href="install.html">Install Instructions</a>.
        If you are compiling using a development environment you may want to read them.</p>
    <p>
        If you have broken brackets with comments attached to the opening bracket instead of the previous line, do the
        following <b>before formatting</b> again with broken brackets. Use the current Artistic Style release (1.21).
        Format the source using attached brackets to reattach the brackets and the comments to the previous line. Then
        format the source again using broken brackets. This will move the brackets to the next line without the comments.
        The comments will now be on the correct line.</p>
    <p>
        There is a new multi-platform GUI program, <b>UniversalIndent</b>, available at <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/universalindent">
            sourceforge.net/projects/universalindent</a>. It allows you to view the effects of the Artistic Style options
        on your source code without saving the file. You can review the results of the formatting options before updating
        the file. It can be used with a test file or with your actual source code. It supports several other formatting
        programs. The <b>Artistic Style for Windows</b> program has been updated to support the current release. It is
        available at <a href="http://jimp03.zxq.net/">jimp03.zxq.net</a></p>
    <p>
        There have been a few inquiries about how to customize Artistic Style for an unsupported format. Changes can be
        made with Python or another text processing program after formatting the source, or you can modify the Artistic
        Style source code itself. The best place to modify the code is usually in ASEnhancer.cpp. The ASEnhancer class
        is called after the main formatting has been done so you are getting a formatted file. If you just need to change
        the indentation of a few things this is probably the best place to do it.</p>
    <p>
        There is now a distribution package for OpenVMS thanks to Jim Duff, an OpenVMS Systems Specialist living in Sydney
        Australia. His website is at <a href="http://www.eight-cubed.com/index.html">eight-cubed.com</a>.</p>
    <p>
        Thanks to Norbert Holzki and Siemens AG, Medical Solutions, Forchheim, Germany for testing the array formatting.</p>
    <p>
        Thanks to Sam Cooler for testing the Mac OS X version.</p>

    <h3>
        Artistic Style 1.20&nbsp; (January 2007)</h3>

    <p>
        Release 1.20.2 fixed problems with the new stream I/O procedure added in release 1.20.1. Release 1.20.1 improved
        the processing for Mac OS X platforms. The compatibility with <a href="http://www.barebones.com/products/textwrangler/"
            target="astyle" title="open new window">TextWrangler</a> was improved. There is now a separate release for
        Mac.</p>
    <p>
        Artistic Style will now indent message maps for Microsoft Foundation Class (MFC) and event tables for wxWidgets.
        The option --brackets=break-closing-headers has been shortened to --brackets=break-closing and a short option
        added (-y). There have been short options added for --break-elseifs (-e), --indent-preprocessor (-w), --break-blocks
        (-f), and --break-blocks=all (-F).</p>
    <p>
        With this release the Artistic Style license changes from the GNU General Public License (GPL) to the GNU <em>Lesser</em>
        General Public License (LGPL). You can use Artistic Style for free or commercial software without charge. Projects
        that use Artistic Style do not have to make the their source code available. If Artistic Style itself is modified,
        however, the modified Artistic Style source code must be made available. See the <a href="license.html">GNU Lesser
            General Public License</a> for more information.</p>
    <p>
        There is a new preprocessor option to aid developers in using Artistic Style with a Graphical User Interface (GUI).
        It is no longer necessary to remove the source module astyle_main.cpp and write embedded code to call the formatter.
        It can be compiled as a static library or a shared library (DLL), or the entire source code can be included in
        the project. See the <a href="develop/">Artistic Style Developer Information</a> for the calling procedure and
        other details.</p>
    <p>
        There is a sample GUI program for Windows available at <a href="http://jimp03.zxq.net/" target="astyle" title="open new window">
            http://jimp03.zxq.net/</a>. It uses the unmodified Artistic Style compiled for a GUI. The source code needs
        some work so it is not available for now. It should work under Linux using WINE. Future enhancements and platform
        support will depend on the response to the sample program.</p>
    <p>
        To support the new Artistic Style preprocessor option there are new makefiles and project files. Windows users
        have a project file for Microsoft Visual C++ 2003 (version 7). Linux users have a new makefile that has several
        new options. The location of both files is in the build directory. Be sure to read the <a href="install.html">Artistic
            Style Install Information</a> for the details.</p>
    <p>
        Intel&reg; is now offering it's C++ and Fortran compilers free for non-commercial use. Information is available
        at the Intel&reg; Software Development Products website. Click on the <a href="http://www3.intel.com/cd/software/products/asmo-na/eng/download/download/"
            target="astyle" title="open new window">Free Non-Commercial Download</a> link to see if you qualify. The Intel
        Compilers on Windows and Linux require that other compilers be installed (Microsoft Visual C++ or GNU gcc respectively).
        This is because the Intel Compilers require the header files, runtime libraries and linkers distributed as part
        of these other compilers. If you want to use this compiler there is now a makefile (makeintel) included with the
        project. See <a href="install.html">Artistic Style Install Information</a> for instructions.</p>
    <p>
        &nbsp;</p>

    <h3>
        Artistic Style 1.19&nbsp; (July 2006)</h3>

    <p>
        Most changes this release were again concerned with the options pad=oper and pad=paren. The formatting still worked
        a little different if both options were declared than if only one was used. The problems with distinguishing the
        multiplication operator from pointers, and of separating an object from the member access pointer (-&gt;) were
        fixed.</p>
    <p>
        A new option, unpad=paren, was added. This will undo the pad=paren, pad=paren-out and pad=paren-in options. It
        can be used alone or with pad=paren-out or pad=paren-in. If used alone it will unpad all parens that have been
        previously padded. If used with a paren padding option, the paren padding option will take precedence and only
        the unnecessary padding will be removed. This will enable the paren padding to be changed in one formatting run.</p>
    <p>
        Padding to paren headers (e.g. "if", "for", "while") was reinstated. This was done in previous releases if pad=oper
        was used. Since most people used this option, the headers were usually padded. The general opinion was that they
        looked better padded, especially in the case of "else if" statements. Since it is a minor point, it was not made
        an option.</p>
    <p>
        This is the third release of Artistic Style in the last four months. The reason for the frequent releases was
        the number of pervasive errors in the formatting. In the future there will probably be two or three new releases
        per year, or one every four to six months. It will take about three years to make all the changes that are planned
        at this time.; The releases will be a combination of fixes, changes to formatting, and new features.</p>
