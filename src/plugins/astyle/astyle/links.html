    <h1>Artistic Style Links</h1>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <p>The following applications use Artistic Style as contributed software. It
    is either embedded in the application or called as a command line program.</p>

    <h3>Graphical User Interfaces</h3>

    <p>Artistic Style is a command line program and, as such, does not give you a chance to review
    the effect of different options before formatting the source code. The following Graphical User
    Interface program will allow you to review the changes before the code is updated. They allow
    you to select the options you want without actually updating the source.</p>

    <p><a href="http://www.geocities.com/jpattee/"
       target="astyle"
       title="open new window"><strong>Artistic Style for Windows</strong></a> is an Artistic Style
       GUI program for Windows. It uses an unmodified Artistic Style program in a Windows GUI. It
       will work under Linux using WINE. Everything done in the editor is undo-able, including
       formatting of the entire document. Documents can be reviewed and reformatted using different
       options. It can be executed from most development environments and will open the currently
       selected document.</p>

    <p><a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/universalindent"
       target="astyle"
       title="open new window"><strong>Universal Indent Gui</strong></a> is a cross platform GUI
       for several code formatters. The main feature is a live preview to show how the selected
       formatting options affect the source code. This allows review and testing of the various
       options before formatting a file. It can be used with a sample file or with your actual
       source code. It is a good way to try out the options from various indentation programs.</p>

    <h3>Development Environments</h3>

    <p>The following development environments use Artistic Style as a contributed add-on.</p>

    <h3>Other</h3>

    <p>The command line build of Artistic Style can be added to nearly any text editor, usually
    through the Tools menu. The text editor should have instructions on how this is done. If you
    have a favorite editor that does not have it, you can usually add it yourself.</p>
