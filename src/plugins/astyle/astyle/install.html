<h2><a name="_Artistic_Style_Versions"></a>Artistic Style Versions</h2>
        
		<p>astyle_x.y_linux.tar.gz is the <b>Linux</b> version of Artistic Style. It 
		    contains the source code, documentation, and makefiles. The Linux 
		Version compile instructions below give information compiling the source 
		code. The Linux shell will allow the use of 
			wildcards (such as *.cpp) during execution.</p>
		<p>astyle_x.y_macosx.tar.gz is the <b>Mac OS X</b> version of Artistic Style. It 
		    contains the source code, documentation, and a makefile. The Mac OS 
		X Version compile instructions below&nbsp; give information compiling 
		the source code. The Mac shell will allow the use of 
			wildcards (such as *.cpp) during execution.</p>
		<p>astyle_x.y_openvms.zip is the <b>OpenVMS</b> version of Artistic 
		Style. It contains the source code, documentation, object files, build 
		files, and an executable.&nbsp; The OpenVMS Version compile instructions 
		below give information compiling the source code. Object code is included for people that don't 
			have the Hewlett-Packard&nbsp; C++ compiler.
			Wildcards are not supported under Digital 
			Command Language (DCL). If the Bash shell has been installed on 
			VMS, wildcards&nbsp; (such as *.cpp) can be used if Artistic Style is run under Bash.</p>
		<p>astyle_x.y_windows.zip is the <b>Windows</b> version of Artistic 
		Style. It contains the source code, documentation, a Visual C project 
		file, and an executable.&nbsp; The Windows Version compile instructions 
		below give information compiling the source code. The pre-compiled 
		executable has been compiled to allow the use 
			of wildcards (such as *.cpp) during execution.</p>
		<p>Only one platform is supported in each distribution package. If you 
		    use Artistic Style on more than one platform you 
			will need to download packages for each platform. 
			The main difference in platforms is the build directory and the 
			line endings. Most compilers and development packages will accept any 
		    type of line ending.</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		
<h2><a name="_Linux_Version"></a>Linux Version</h2>
		
		<h3><a name="_GCC_Compiler"></a>GCC Compiler</h3>
		<p>To compile using the GCC compiler you must have GCC (3.1 or better) installed. 
			To build the Artistic Style configurations use the makefile located in the astyle/build 
		directory.&nbsp; The executables will be in the astyle/bin directory.&nbsp; 
		To build the command line configuration enter the following:</p>
		<pre>    cd astyle/build
    make</pre>
		<p>To build the other astyle configurations you can enter the file name or a 
		symbolic name.&nbsp; Entering &quot;make astyle&quot; or &quot;make release&quot; will build the command line configuration.&nbsp; Following are the symbolic 
		names and file names (in parens) of the various configurations:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><b>release</b> builds the Artistic Style command line program 
			(astyle).&nbsp; This is the default option.</li>
			<li><b>shared</b> builds the Artistic Style program as a 
			shared library (libastyle.so).</li>
			<li><b>static</b> builds the Artistic Style program as a static 
			library (libastyle.a).</li>
			<li><b>debug</b> builds the Artistic Style command line program with 
			debugging information&nbsp; (astyled).</li>
			<li><b>shareddebug</b> builds the Artistic Style program as a shared 
			library with debugging information (libastyled.so).</li>
			<li><b>staticdebug</b> builds the Artistic Style program as a static 
			library with debugging information (libastyled.a).</li>
			<li><b>all</b> builds all of the above configurations.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>More than one configuration can be built at the same time.&nbsp; 
		For example, to build all of the release configurations enter:</p>
		<pre>    cd astyle/build
    make release shared static</pre>
		<h3><a name="_Intel_Compiler"></a>Intel Compiler</h3>
		<p>The Intel makefile is named <b>makeintel.</b>
			To build astyle, use the makeintel file located in the astyle/build 
		directory.&nbsp; The executables will be in the astyle/bin directory.&nbsp; 
		To build the command line configuration enter the following:</p>
		<pre>    cd astyle/build
    make -f makeintel</pre>
		<p>Another way to compile with Intel is to rename "makeintel" as "makefile". Then the -f option is not needed.
			If this is done the Intel makefile will always be used instead of the GCC makefile.
	
          	<p>The configuration names for Intel are the same as for the 
			<a href="#_GCC_Compiler">GCC compiler</a>.&nbsp; 
			More than one configuration can be built at the same time.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
			For example, to build all of the debug configurations enter:</p>
		<pre>    cd astyle/build
    make -f makeintel debug shareddebug staticdebug</pre>
			
	<h3><a name="_Other_Makefile_Options"></a>Other Makefile Options</h3>
		<p>The following options are also available. If you are using the Intel 
		compiler, the make filename option must be included in the command (-f 
		makeintel).</p>
		<h5>clean</h5>
		<p>To remove the object files for all configurations:</p>
		<pre>    make clean</pre>
		<p>The executables will not be removed.</p>
		<h5>install</h5>
		<p>You must have the appropriate permissions to use install.&nbsp; To install the 
		astyle executable to /usr/bin:</p>
		<pre>    make install</pre>
		<p>To install the executable to a different directory set a value 
				for the macro $(prefix).&nbsp; For example to install the executable to a users 
				home directory (/home/<i>user</i>/bin):</p>
		<pre>   make prefix=$HOME/bin install</pre>
		<h5>uninstall</h5>
		<p>You must have the appropriate permissions to use uninstall.&nbsp; To uninstall the 
		astyle executable from /usr/bin:</p>
		<pre>    make uninstall</pre>
		<p>To uninstall the executable from a different directory set a 
				value for the macro $(prefix).&nbsp; For example to uninstall the executable 
				from a users home directory (/home/<i>user</i>/bin):</p>
		<pre>   make prefix=$HOME/bin uninstall</pre>
		<p>NOTE: The uninstall option will NOT remove the .astylerc 
				files from the users home directories.&nbsp; The files must be 
				removed&nbsp; individually for each user.</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
				
<h2><a name="_Mac_OS_X_Version"></a>Mac OS X Version</h2>
		
		<p>Mac OS X uses the same makefile as Linux GCC. To build the Artistic 
		Style configurations use the makefile located in the astyle/build 
		directory.&nbsp; The executables will be in the astyle/bin directory.&nbsp; 
		To build the command line configuration enter the following:</p>
		<pre>    cd astyle/build
    make</pre>
	
          	<p>The configurations for Mac are the same as for the 
			<a href="#_GCC_Compiler">Linux GCC compiler</a>.&nbsp; 
			More than one configuration can be built at the same time.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
			For example, to build all of the release configurations enter:</p>
		<pre>    cd astyle/build
    make release shared static</pre>
			
		<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2><a name="_OpenVMS_Version"></a>OpenVMS Version</h2>
		
		<p>To build Artistic Style on an OpenVMS system, you will need 
		Hewlett-Packard 's C++ 
		compiler installed. To build the code, use the OpenVMS 
		specific build file located in the astyle/build directory. The executables 
		will be in the astyle/bin directory. To build, enter the following:</p>
		<pre>    set def [.astyle.build]
    @vmsbuild</pre>
 		<p>To run Artistic Style, you should move the executable to an appropriate
 		directory, and create a foreign symbol for it. For example:</p>
 		<pre>    create/dir my_disk:[astyle.exe]
    set def [-.bin]
    copy astyle_main.exe my_disk:[astyle.exe]
    ast*yle :== $my_disk:[astyle.exe]astyle_main.exe</pre>
 		<p>If you use Artistic Style on ODS-2 disks, you will need to specify a 
		different suffix for file renaming, as the default is .orig, and multi-dot 
 		filenames are not supported on ODS-2 disks. Add the --suffix=_orig switch 
 		to either the command line or your Artistic Style initialization file.</p>
 		<p>To set up an initialization file on OpenVMS, create a file and define a 
		logical to point to it. For example:</p>
		<pre>    create my_disk:[astyle]astyle.ini
    --suffix=_orig
    ^Z
    define artistic_style_options my_disk:[astyle]astyle.ini</pre>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2><a name="_Windows_Version"></a></a>Windows Version</h2>
		
		<h3><a name="_Precompiled_Executable"></a>Precompiled Executable</h3>
		
		<p>In addition to the source files, the Windows version contains an astyle executable (AStyle.exe).
			The executable is compiled to allow wildcard use during execution.</p>
			
		<h3><a name="_Visual_C++_Compiler"></a>Visual C++ Compiler</h3>
		
		<p>There is a project file for Visual C++ 2003 (version 7) or higher.&nbsp; 
		Open the file AStyle.sln in the AStyle/build directory.&nbsp; Select the 
		Release configuration to compile the command line version.&nbsp; All 
		output files will be in the AStyle/bin directory.&nbsp; The 
		project has the following configurations.</p>
		<ul>
			<li><b>Release</b> builds the Artistic Style command line program 
			(AStyle.exe).&nbsp; </li>
			<li><b>Release Dll</b> builds the Artistic Style program as a Dynamic Link 
			Library (AStyle.dll).&nbsp; This will also produce the exports 
			library and the static library for linking the dll.</li>
			<li><b>Release Lib</b> builds the Artistic Style program as a Static 
			Library (libAStyle.lib).</li>
			<li><b>Debug</b> builds the Artistic Style command line program with 
			debugging information&nbsp; (AStyled.exe).</li>
			<li><b>Debug Dll</b> builds the Artistic Style program as a Dynamic Link 
			Library (DLL) with debugging information (AStyled.dll).&nbsp; This 
			will also produce the exports library and the static library for 
			linking the dll.</li>
			<li><b>Debug Lib</b> builds the Artistic Style program as a Static 
			Library with debugging information (libAStyled.lib).</li>
		</ul>
		
		<h3><a name="_Other_Compilers"></a>Other Compilers</h3>
		
		<p>To use other compilers a project file must be built using the 
		compiler's development environment.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Create a project using the compiler's development environment</li>
			<li>Add to the project all the .cpp and .h files in the src directory.</li>
			<li>In order to use wildcards (such as *.cpp) during execution:<br>
			With Visual C++, insert "setargv.obj" to the list of linker additional dependencies.<br>
			With the MinGW build of the GCC compiler, the use of wildcards is automatic.<br>
			With Borland, add "wildargs.obj" to the list of linker object files.<br>
			With other compilers I don't know of a way to allow wildcards.  I would appreciate the information if 
			   anyone knows.</li>
			<li>The Compiler Options section discusses the compiler options to use.</li>
			<li>Compile.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2><a name="_Compiler_Options"></a>Compiler Options</h2>
		
		<p>To compile as a static or shared (dynamic) library define the macro ASTYLE_LIB. 
		Then use the appropriate compiler and linker options to compile the 
		static or shared library.</p>
		<p> Artistic Style is a small program and it is best to optimize for 
		speed. The debug configuration is not usually optimized. To optimize for speed in the release configuration use the macro NDEBUG to remove asserts. Use an option that allows inline function 
		expansion. 
		Runtime Type Information (RTTI) is NOT needed. Use whole program 
		speed optimization if your compiler supports it. There may be other options 
		you can use depending on the compiler.</p>
