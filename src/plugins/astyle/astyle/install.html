        <blockquote>
 
        <h2><a name="_Artistic_Style_Versions"></a>Artistic Style Versions</h2>
		<p>astyle_x.y_linux.tar.gz is the Linux version of Artistic Style. It 
		contains the source code, documentation, and makefiles for compiling the 
		source code.  Refer to the Linux Version compile 
			instructions below.  Refer to the documentation for instructions on
			executing AStyle.exe.  The Linux shell will allow the use of 
			wildcards (such as *.cpp) during execution.</p>
		<p>astyle_x.y_windows.zip is the Windows version of Artistic Style.  It
			contains the source code, documentation, a Visual C project file, and an executable, AStyle.exe.  Refer to the documentation for instructions on
			executing AStyle.exe.  It has been compiled to allow the use 
			of wildcards (such as *.cpp) during execution.</p>
		<p>astyle_x.y_macosx.tar.gz is the Mac OS X version of Artistic Style. It 
		contains the source code, documentation, and a makefile for compiling the 
		source code.  Refer to the Mac OS X Version compile 
			instructions below.  Refer to the documentation for instructions on
			executing AStyle.exe.  The Mac shell will allow the use of 
			wildcards (such as *.cpp) during execution.</p>
		<p>The build directory in all versions contains all the makefiles 
		and project files. If you want all platforms you need to 
		download only one distribution package. The difference in distribution 
		packages are the 
		line endings and the executable included with Windows. Most development 
		environments and compilers will accept either type of line ending.</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		
		<h2><a name="_Linux_Version"></a>Linux Version</h2>
		
		<h3><a name="_GCC_Compiler"></a>GCC Compiler</h3>
		<p>To compile using the GCC compiler you must have GCC (3.1 or better) installed. 
			To build the Artistic Style configurations use the makefile located in the astyle/build 
		directory.&nbsp; The executables will be in the astyle/bin directory.&nbsp; 
		To build the command line configuration enter the following:</p>
		<pre>    cd astyle/build
    make</pre>
		<p>To build the other astyle configurations you can enter the file name or a 
		symbolic name.&nbsp; Entering &quot;make astyle&quot; or &quot;make release&quot; will build the command line configuration.&nbsp; Following are the symbolic 
		names and file names (in parens) of the various configurations:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><b>release</b> builds the Artistic Style command line program 
			(astyle).&nbsp; This is the default option.</li>
			<li><b>shared</b> builds the Artistic Style program as a 
			shared library (libastyle.so).</li>
			<li><b>static</b> builds the Artistic Style program as a static 
			library (libastyle.a).</li>
			<li><b>debug</b> builds the Artistic Style command line program with 
			debugging information&nbsp; (astyled).</li>
			<li><b>shareddebug</b> builds the Artistic Style program as a shared 
			library with debugging information (libastyled.so).</li>
			<li><b>staticdebug</b> builds the Artistic Style program as a static 
			library with debugging information (libastyled.a).</li>
			<li><b>all</b> builds all of the above configurations.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>More than one configuration can be built at the same time.&nbsp; 
		For example, to build all of the release configurations enter:</p>
		<pre>    cd astyle/build
    make release shared static</pre>
		<h3><a name="_Intel_Compiler"></a>Intel Compiler</h3>
		<p>The Intel makefile is named <b>makeintel.</b>
			To build astyle, use the makeintel file located in the astyle/build 
		directory.&nbsp; The executables will be in the astyle/bin directory.&nbsp; 
		To build the command line configuration enter the following:</p>
		<pre>    cd astyle/build
    make -f makeintel</pre>
		<p>Another way to compile with Intel is to rename "makeintel" as "makefile". Then the -f option is not needed.
			If this is done the Intel makefile will always be used instead of the GCC makefile.
	
          	<p>The configuration names for Intel are the same as for the 
			<a href="#_GCC_Compiler">GCC compiler</a>.&nbsp; 
			More than one configuration can be built at the same time.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
			For example, to build all of the debug configurations enter:</p>
		<pre>    cd astyle/build
    make -f makeintel debug shareddebug staticdebug</pre>
			
	<h3><a name="_Other_Makefile_Options"></a>Other Makefile Options</h3>
		<p>The following options do not depend on the compiler and can be run using either makefile.</p>
		<h5>clean</h5>
		<p>To remove the object files for all configurations:</p>
		<pre>    make clean</pre>
		<p>The executables will not be removed.</p>
		<h5>install</h5>
		<p>You must have the appropriate permissions to use install.&nbsp; To install the 
		astyle executable to /usr/bin:</p>
		<pre>    make install</pre>
		<p>To install the executable to a different directory set a value 
				for the macro $(prefix).&nbsp; For example to install the executable to a users 
				home directory (/home/<i>user</i>/bin):</p>
		<pre>   make prefix=$HOME/bin install</pre>
		<h5>uninstall</h5>
		<p>You must have the appropriate permissions to use uninstall.&nbsp; To uninstall the 
		astyle executable from /usr/bin:</p>
		<pre>    make uninstall</pre>
		<p>To uninstall the executable from a different directory set a 
				value for the macro $(prefix).&nbsp; For example to uninstall the executable 
				from a users home directory (/home/<i>user</i>/bin):</p>
		<pre>   make prefix=$HOME/bin uninstall</pre>
		<p>NOTE: The uninstall option will NOT remove the .astylerc 
				files from the users home directories.&nbsp; The files must be 
				removed&nbsp; individually for each user.</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		
		<h2><a name="_Windows_Version"></a></a>Windows Version</h2>
		
		<h3><a name="_Precompiled_Executable"></a>Precompiled Executable</h3>
		<p>In addition to the source files, the Windows version contains an astyle executable (AStyle.exe).
			The executable is compiled to allow wildcard use during execution.</p>
			
		<h3><a name="_Visual_C++_Compiler"></a>Visual C++ Compiler</h3>
		<p>There is a project file for Visual C++ 2003 (version 7) or higher.&nbsp; 
		Open the file AStyle.sln in the AStyle/build directory.&nbsp; Select the 
		Release configuration to compile the command line version.&nbsp; All 
		output files will be in the AStyle/bin directory.&nbsp; The 
		project has the following configurations.</p>
		<ul>
			<li><b>Release</b> builds the Artistic Style command line program 
			(AStyle.exe).&nbsp; </li>
			<li><b>Release Dll</b> builds the Artistic Style program as a Dynamic Link 
			Library (AStyle.dll).&nbsp; This will also produce the exports 
			library and the static library for linking the dll.</li>
			<li><b>Release Lib</b> builds the Artistic Style program as a Static 
			Library (libAStyle.lib).</li>
			<li><b>Debug</b> builds the Artistic Style command line program with 
			debugging information&nbsp; (AStyled.exe).</li>
			<li><b>Debug Dll</b> builds the Artistic Style program as a Dynamic Link 
			Library (DLL) with debugging information (AStyled.dll).&nbsp; This 
			will also produce the exports library and the static library for 
			linking the dll.</li>
			<li><b>Debug Lib</b> builds the Artistic Style program as a Static 
			Library with debugging information (libAStyled.lib).</li>
		</ul>
		
		<h3><a name="_Other_Compilers"></a>Other Compilers</h3>
		<p>To use other compilers a project file must be built using the 
		compiler's development environment.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Create a project using the compiler's development environment</li>
			<li>Add to the project all the .cpp and .h files in the src directory.</li>
			<li>In order to use wildcards (such as *.cpp) during execution:<br>
			With Visual C++, insert "setargv.obj" to the list of linker additional dependencies.<br>
			With the MinGW build of the GCC compiler, the use of wildcards is automatic.<br>
			With other compilers I don't know of a way to allow wildcards.  I would appreciate the information if 
			   anyone knows.</li>
			<li>Compile... It is usually best to optimize the program for speed.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>To compile as a static or dynamic library define the macro ASTYLE_LIB. 
		Then use the appropriate compiler and linker options to compile the 
		library or DLL.</p>
		
		<h2><a name="_Mac_OS_X_Version"></a>Mac OS X Version</h2>
		<p>Mac OS X uses the same makefile as Linux GCC. To build the Artistic 
		Style configurations use the makefile located in the astyle/build 
		directory.&nbsp; The executables will be in the astyle/bin directory.&nbsp; 
		To build the command line configuration enter the following:</p>
		<pre>    cd astyle/build
    make</pre>
	
          	<p>The configurations for Mac are the same as for the 
			<a href="#_GCC_Compiler">Linux GCC compiler</a>.&nbsp; 
			More than one configuration can be built at the same time.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
			For example, to build all of the release configurations enter:</p>
		<pre>    cd astyle/build
    make release shared static</pre>
			
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
