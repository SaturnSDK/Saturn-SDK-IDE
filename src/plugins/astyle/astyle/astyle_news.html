        <blockquote>
        
 			<h3>Artistic Style 1.21&nbsp; (June 2007)</h3>
 			<blockquote>

				<p>This release contains many bug fixes. Array formatting and indentation has been improved. Arrays 
				and enums are now formatted by a different procedure than 
				functions. Brackets will now attach to lines with comments. 
				Brackets will be broken from lines with comments without 
                bringing the comments with them. All comments will remain in their 
                original column, if possible. The formatting of empty blocks was 
				fixed. The BracketType definition was expanded and the bracket 
				types are now correctly identified. There are several formatting 
				fixes for Java files. See the 
				<a href="astyle_notes.html">Release Notes</a> for a complete 
				list of changes.</p>
				<p>A new option, --preserve-date (-Z), has been added.&nbsp; This 
				will retain the date modified of the original 
				file&nbsp;in the new formatted file. Otherwise the new file will 
				contain the current date.</p>
				<p>The option --errors-to-standard-output has been 
                shortened to  
        		--errors-to-stdout. The <b>short</b> options -c (mode=c) and -j 
				(mode=java) have been removed. The options should seldom be needed 
				since the mode is now set automatically from the file extension 
				for <b>each source 
				file</b> instead of for each program execution. A new long option --mode=cs 
				(C#) has been added. Key words are now set for each file 
				depending on the file mode (C, 
				Java, or C#). This will eliminate formatting problems caused by 
				not being able to identify the source code language.</p>
				<p>There has been a change to the Linux style bracket 
				formatting for C++ header files. In the past 
				brackets have been broken for function definitions within a 
				class. With this release 
				the brackets will be attached. The 
				brackets will also be attached for arrays, structs, enums, and 
				other top level objects that are not classes or functions. The 
				Linux style formatting for Java and C# has not been changed.</p>
				<p>This release supports only one platform in each distribution 
				package. In the past all platforms were included in every 
				package. If you use Artistic Style on more than one platform you 
				will need to download packages for each platform. 
				The main difference in platforms is the build directory and the 
				line endings. The source code and documentation are the same for 
				all packages.</p>				
				<p>There are new instructions about optimizing compiler options in 
				the <a href="install.html">Install Instructions</a>. 
				If you are compiling using a development environment you may want 
				to read them. </p>
				<p>If you have broken brackets with comments attached to the 
				opening bracket instead of the previous line, do the following
                <b>before formatting</b> again with broken brackets. Use the 
				current Artistic Style release (1.21). Format the source using 
				attached brackets to reattach the brackets and the comments to 
				the previous line. Then format the source again using broken 
				brackets. This will move the brackets to the next line without 
				the comments. The comments will now be on the correct line.</p>
				<p>There is a new multi-platform GUI program, <b>UniversalIndent</b>, available at
				<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/universalindent">
				sourceforge.net/projects/universalindent</a>. It allows 
				you to view the effects of the Artistic Style options on your 
				source code without saving the file. You can review the results of 
				the formatting options before updating the file. It can be used 
				with a test file or with your actual source code. It supports several 
				other formatting programs. The <b>Artistic Style for 
				Windows</b> program has been updated to support the current release. It is 
				available at <a href="http://www.geocities.com/jpattee/">
				www.geocities.com/jpattee/</a></p>
				<p>There have been a few inquiries about how to customize 
				Artistic Style 
				for an unsupported format. Changes can be made&nbsp; with Python or 
				another text processing program after formatting the source, or you can modify the Artistic 
				Style source code itself. The best place to modify the code is 
				usually in ASEnhancer.cpp. The ASEnhancer class is called after 
				the main formatting has been done so you are getting a formatted 
				file. If you just need to change the indentation of a few things 
				this is probably the best place to do it.</p>
				<p>There is now a distribution package for OpenVMS thanks to
				Jim Duff, an OpenVMS Systems Specialist living in Sydney Australia. 
				His website is at <a class="url" href="http://www.eight-cubed.com/index.html">
				eight-cubed.com</a>.</p>
				<p>Thanks to
							Norbert Holzki and 
				
				Siemens AG, 
				Medical Solutions, Forchheim, Germany for testing the array 
				formatting.</p>
				<p>Thanks to Sam Cooler for testing the Mac OS X version.</p>

             <blockquote>
             
             	<p>Release 1.20.2 fixed problems with the new stream I/O 
				procedure added in release 1.20.1.&nbsp;Release 1.20.1&nbsp;improved the processing for Mac OS X 
				platforms. The compatibility with 
				<a href="http://assortedgeekery.com/archives/2005/03/22/reindenting-c-in-textwrangler-and-bbedit-using-astyle" 
				target="_blank" title="open new window">TextWrangler</a> was improved. 
				There is now a separate release for Mac. </p>

           		<p>Artistic Style will now indent message maps for Microsoft 
                Foundation Class (MFC) and event tables for wxWidgets. The option <nobr>--brackets=break-closing-headers</nobr> has been 
                shortened to <nobr>--brackets=break-closing</nobr> and a short option added <nobr>(-y).</nobr> There have been short options added for 
                <nobr>--break-elseifs</nobr> <nobr>(-e),</nobr> <nobr>--indent-preprocessor</nobr> <nobr>(-w),</nobr> <nobr>--break-blocks</nobr> 
                <nobr>(-f),</nobr> and <nobr>--break-blocks=all</nobr> <nobr>(-F).</nobr></p>

                <p>With this release the Artistic Style license changes from the 
				GNU General Public License (GPL) to the GNU <em>Lesser</em> General Public 
				License (LGPL). You can use Artistic Style for free or 
				commercial software without charge. Projects that use Artistic Style do not 
				have to make the their source code available. If Artistic Style 
				itself is modified, however, the modified Artistic Style source 
				code must be made available. See the
				<a href="license.html">GNU Lesser General Public License</a> for 
				more information.</p>
				<p>There is a new preprocessor option to aid developers in using Artistic Style with a Graphical User Interface 
						(GUI). It is no longer necessary to remove the source 
						module astyle_main.cpp and write embedded code to call 
						the formatter. It can be compiled as a static library 
				or a shared library (DLL), or the entire source 
						code can be included in the project. See the
				<a href="develop.html">Artistic Style Developer Information</a> 
				for the calling procedure and other details.</p>
				<p>There is a sample GUI program for Windows available at
				<a href="http://www.geocities.com/jpattee/"  target="_blank"
				title="open new window">http://www.geocities.com/jpattee/</a>. 
				It uses the unmodified 
				Artistic Style compiled for a GUI. The source code needs some 
				work so it is not available for now. It should work under Linux 
				using WINE. Future enhancements and platform support will depend 
				on the response to the sample program.</p>
				<p>To support the new Artistic Style preprocessor option there are new 
				makefiles and project files. Windows users have a project 
				file for Microsoft Visual C++ 2003 (version 7). Linux users have 
				a new makefile that has several new options. The location 
				of both files is in the build directory.  Be sure to read 
				the <a href="install.html">Artistic Style Install Information</a> 
				for the details.</p>
				
				<p>Intel® is now offering it's C++ and Fortran compilers free for 
				non-commercial use.  Information is available at the 
				<a href="http://www3.intel.com/cd/software/products/asmo-na/eng/" 
				 target="_blank"
				title="open new window">Intel® 
				Software Development Products</a> website. Click on the 
				<a href="http://www3.intel.com/cd/software/products/asmo-na/eng/download/download/" 
				 target="_blank" title="open new window">
				Free Non-Commercial Download</a> link to see if you qualify. The Intel 
				Compilers on Windows and Linux require that other compilers be 
				installed (Microsoft Visual C++ or GNU gcc respectively). This 
				is because the Intel Compilers require the header files, runtime 
				libraries and linkers distributed as part of these other 
				compilers. If you want to use this compiler there is now a makefile (makeintel) 
				included with the project.  See <a href="install.html">Artistic Style Install Information</a> 
				for instructions.</p>

                <p>Most changes this release were again concerned with the 
                options pad=oper and pad=paren.&nbsp; The formatting still 
                worked a little different if both options were declared than if 
                only one was used.&nbsp; The problems with distinguishing the 
				multiplication operator from pointers, and of separating an object from 
				the member access pointer (-&gt;) were fixed.</p>

                <p>A new option, unpad=paren, was added.&nbsp; This will undo 
                the pad=paren, pad=paren-out and pad=paren-in options.&nbsp; It can be 
                used alone or with pad=paren-out or pad=paren-in.&nbsp; If used alone it will unpad all parens that have 
                been previously padded.&nbsp; If used with a paren padding 
                option, the paren padding option will take precedence and  
                only the unnecessary padding will be removed.&nbsp; This will 
                enable the paren padding to be changed in one formatting run.</p>

                <p>Padding to paren headers (e.g. &quot;if&quot;, &quot;for&quot;, &quot;while&quot;) was 
                reinstated.&nbsp; This was done in previous releases if pad=oper 
                was used.&nbsp; Since most people used this option, the headers 
                were usually padded.&nbsp; The general opinion was that they 
                looked better padded, especially in the case of &quot;else if&quot; 
                statements.&nbsp; Since it is a minor point, it was not made an 
                option.</p>

                <p>This is&nbsp;the third release of Artistic Style in the last 
                four months.&nbsp; The reason for the frequent releases was 
                the number of pervasive errors in the formatting.&nbsp; In the 
                future there will probably be two or three new releases per 
                year, or one every four to six months.&nbsp; It will take about 
                three years to make all the changes that are planned at this 
                time.&nbsp; The releases will be a combination of fixes, changes 
                to formatting, and new features.&nbsp; </p>
