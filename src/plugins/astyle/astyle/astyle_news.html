            <H3>Artistic Style 1.20&nbsp; (January 2007)</H3>
        
             <blockquote>
             
             	<p>Release 1.20.2 fixed problems with the new stream I/O 
				procedure added in release 1.20.1.&nbsp;Release 1.20.1&nbsp;improved the processing for Mac OS X 
				platforms. The compatibility with 
				<a href="http://assortedgeekery.com/archives/2005/03/22/reindenting-c-in-textwrangler-and-bbedit-using-astyle" 
				target="_blank" title="open new window">TextWrangler</a> was improved. 
				There is now a separate release for Mac. </p>

           		<p>Artistic Style will now indent message maps for Microsoft 
                Foundation Class (MFC) and event tables for wxWidgets. The option <nobr>--brackets=break-closing-headers</nobr> has been 
                shortened to <nobr>--brackets=break-closing</nobr> and a short option added <nobr>(-y).</nobr> There have been short options added for 
                <nobr>--break-elseifs</nobr> <nobr>(-e),</nobr> <nobr>--indent-preprocessor</nobr> <nobr>(-w),</nobr> <nobr>--break-blocks</nobr> 
                <nobr>(-f),</nobr> and <nobr>--break-blocks=all</nobr> <nobr>(-F).</nobr></p>

                <p>With this release the Artistic Style license changes from the 
				GNU General Public License (GPL) to the GNU <em>Lesser</em> General Public 
				License (LGPL). You can use Artistic Style for free or 
				commercial software without charge. Projects that use Artistic Style do not 
				have to make the their source code available. If Artistic Style 
				itself is modified, however, the modified Artistic Style source 
				code must be made available. See the
				<a href="license.html">GNU Lesser General Public License</a> for 
				more information.</p>
				<p>There is a new preprocessor option to aid developers in using Artistic Style with a Graphical User Interface 
						(GUI). It is no longer necessary to remove the source 
						module astyle_main.cpp and write embedded code to call 
						the formatter. It can be compiled as a static library 
				or a shared library (DLL), or the entire source 
						code can be included in the project. See the
				<a href="develop.html">Artistic Style Developer Information</a> 
				for the calling procedure and other details.</p>
				<p>There is a sample GUI program for Windows available at
				<a href="http://www.geocities.com/jpattee/"  target="_blank"
				title="open new window">http://www.geocities.com/jpattee/</a>. 
				It uses the unmodified 
				Artistic Style compiled for a GUI. The source code needs some 
				work so it is not available for now. It should work under Linux 
				using WINE. Future enhancements and platform support will depend 
				on the response to the sample program.</p>
				<p>To support the new Artistic Style preprocessor option there are new 
				makefiles and project files. Windows users have a project 
				file for Microsoft Visual C++ 2003 (version 7). Linux users have 
				a new makefile that has several new options. The location 
				of both files is in the build directory.  Be sure to read 
				the <a href="install.html">Artistic Style Install Information</a> 
				for the details.</p>
				
				<p>Intel® is now offering it's C++ and Fortran compilers free for 
				non-commercial use.  Information is available at the 
				<a href="http://www3.intel.com/cd/software/products/asmo-na/eng/" 
				 target="_blank"
				title="open new window">Intel® 
				Software Development Products</a> website. Click on the 
				<a href="http://www3.intel.com/cd/software/products/asmo-na/eng/download/download/" 
				 target="_blank" title="open new window">
				Free Non-Commercial Download</a> link to see if you qualify. The Intel 
				Compilers on Windows and Linux require that other compilers be 
				installed (Microsoft Visual C++ or GNU gcc respectively). This 
				is because the Intel Compilers require the header files, runtime 
				libraries and linkers distributed as part of these other 
				compilers. If you want to use this compiler there is now a makefile (makeintel) 
				included with the project.  See <a href="install.html">Artistic Style Install Information</a> 
				for instructions.</p>

            <blockquote>

                <p>Most changes this release were again concerned with the 
                options pad=oper and pad=paren.&nbsp; The formatting still 
                worked a little different if both options were declared than if 
                only one was used.&nbsp; The problems with distinguishing the 
				multiplication operator from pointers, and of separating an object from 
				the member access pointer (-&gt;) were fixed.</p>

                <p>A new option, unpad=paren, was added.&nbsp; This will undo 
                the pad=paren, pad=paren-out and pad=paren-in options.&nbsp; It can be 
                used alone or with pad=paren-out or pad=paren-in.&nbsp; If used alone it will unpad all parens that have 
                been previously padded.&nbsp; If used with a paren padding 
                option, the paren padding option will take precedence and  
                only the unnecessary padding will be removed.&nbsp; This will 
                enable the paren padding to be changed in one formatting run.</p>

                <p>Padding to paren headers (e.g. &quot;if&quot;, &quot;for&quot;, &quot;while&quot;) was 
                reinstated.&nbsp; This was done in previous releases if pad=oper 
                was used.&nbsp; Since most people used this option, the headers 
                were usually padded.&nbsp; The general opinion was that they 
                looked better padded, especially in the case of &quot;else if&quot; 
                statements.&nbsp; Since it is a minor point, it was not made an 
                option.</p>

                <p>This is&nbsp;the third release of Artistic Style in the last 
                four months.&nbsp; The reason for the frequent releases was 
                the number of pervasive errors in the formatting.&nbsp; In the 
                future there will probably be two or three new releases per 
                year, or one every four to six months.&nbsp; It will take about 
                three years to make all the changes that are planned at this 
                time.&nbsp; The releases will be a combination of fixes, changes 
                to formatting, and new features.&nbsp; </p>

                <p>&nbsp;</p>
