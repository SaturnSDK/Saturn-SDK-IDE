            <blockquote>

                <p>Most changes this release were again concerned with the 
                options pad=oper and pad=paren.&nbsp; The formatting still 
                worked a little different if both options were declared than if 
                only one was used.&nbsp; The problems with distinguishing the 
				multiplication operator from pointers, and of separating an object from 
				the member access pointer (-&gt;) were fixed.</p>

                <p>A new option, unpad=paren, was added.&nbsp; This will undo 
                the pad=paren, pad=paren-out and pad=paren-in options.&nbsp; It can be 
                used alone or with pad=paren-out or pad=paren-in.&nbsp; If used alone it will unpad all parens that have 
                been previously padded.&nbsp; If used with a paren padding 
                option, the paren padding option will take precedence and  
                only the unnecessary padding will be removed.&nbsp; This will 
                enable the paren padding to be changed in one formatting run.</p>

                <p>Padding to paren headers (e.g. &quot;if&quot;, &quot;for&quot;, &quot;while&quot;) was 
                reinstated.&nbsp; This was done in previous releases if pad=oper 
                was used.&nbsp; Since most people used this option, the headers 
                were usually padded.&nbsp; The general opinion was that they 
                looked better padded, especially in the case of &quot;else if&quot; 
                statements.&nbsp; Since it is a minor point, it was not made an 
                option.</p>

                <p>This is&nbsp;the third release of Artistic Style in the last 
                four months.&nbsp; The reason for the frequent releases was 
                the number of pervasive errors in the formatting.&nbsp; In the 
                future there will probably be two or three new releases per 
                year, or one every four to six months.&nbsp; It will take about 
                three years to make all the changes that are planned at this 
                time.&nbsp; The releases will be a combination of fixes, changes 
                to formatting, and new features.&nbsp; </p>
