To compile under Linux / Unix / Cygwin:
---------------------------------------

Simply type "make". This should create an executable file
called "astyle" (or, under cygwin, "astyle.exe"). Use the
executable as-is, or put it somewhere in your command path.

If you want an executable printing trace information on
standard error and having debug information compiled in,
type "make CXXFLAGS=-g".

To compile under VisualC++:
---------------------------

1. Create a project and import all the .cpp and .h files.
2. In order to have Artistic Style expand wildcards (such as "*.cpp"),
   insert "setargv.obj" to the list of files to link. (Thanks to
   Nat for the info!)
3. Compile as Release version.

If you want an executable printing trace information on
standard error, simply compile as Debug version.
