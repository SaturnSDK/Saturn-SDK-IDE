Welcome to Artistic Style!

Linux Version:
================
To compile under linux/unix/cygwin:
-----------------------------------

You must first have GCC (3.1 or better) installed.  Other C++ 
compilers may work but will require tweaking the make file.

To build astyle, use the makefile located in the astyle/src directory:
	cd astyle/src
	make
	cd ../..
    
To clean the object files:
	make clean
    
The Linux GCC compiler will automatically allow the use of wildcards 
(such as "*.cpp") during execution.


Windows Version:
================
Precompiled executable:
-----------------------
In addition to the sources the Windows version contains, 
an astyle executable (AStyle.exe).

The executable is compiled to allow wildcard use during execution.

To compile under Windows:
-------------------------

1. Create a project under Visual C++ (or another compiler) and add
   all the .cpp and .h files.
   
2. In order to use wildcards (such as "*.cpp") during execution:
   With Visual C++, insert "setargv.obj" to the list of linker additional 
   dependencies.
   With the MinGW build of the GCC compiler, the use of wildcards is 
   automatic.
   With other compilers I don't know of a way to allow wildcards.  If 
   anyone knows, I would appreciate the information.

3. Compile...
   It is usually best to optimize the program for speed.


Enjoy!
