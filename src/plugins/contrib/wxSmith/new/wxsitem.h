/** \brief Base class for all items in resource
 *
 * This class is unified interface for all items which can be used
 * to build resource. These items are:
 * \li \link wxsWidget Standard widgets which can not have child items \endlink
 * \li \link wxsContainer Widgets \ windows which can have items inside \endlink
 * \li \link wxsSizer All sizers \endlink
 * \li \link wxsSpacer Spacer \endlink (although this is only one item, it must be threated especially)
 * \li \link wxsTool Tools - items not visible like wxTimer \endlink
 *
 * Each item has two properties - identifier and variable name. These properties
 * are enabled through wxsFLVariable and wxsFLId flags (declared in wxsglobals.h)
 *
 * Due to some problems with calling virtual functions in constructor, Item
 * is initialized in two steps. First, constructor and than Create function are
 * called. Create is virtual so it could be overridden to use additional
 * setup, but it usually won't be necessarry. In default implementation, it
 * initializes components which are using virtual functions of wxsItem class.
 *
 * Create Function is automatically called inside wxsWidgetFactory class
 * (not wxsWidgetManager !!!), so there's no need to remember about calling that
 * manually.
 *
 * \note Parent of item is automatically set up when adding item to wxsParentClass
 *       using wxsParent::AddChild
