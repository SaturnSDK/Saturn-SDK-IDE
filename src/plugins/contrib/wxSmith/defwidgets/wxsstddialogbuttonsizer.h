/* TODO (TakeshiMiya##): These bool/checkboxs are not used for now...
    ...because I don't know how to do this:
    1) Create buttons on the fly, from toggling these checkbox properties.
    2) The buttons itself should not permit change their own ID name/value.
       But they should permit changing all other button properties.
    3) This sizer only should supports buttons. A message box should error if the user
       tries to add any other widget than a button.
    4) Buttons must not can be added by the user, the buttons should only be created by
       this sizer. A message box should error here also.
    5) Some options are mutually exclusive, namely:
       (wxID_OK, wxID_YES, wxID_SAVE) and (wxID_HELP, wxID_CONTEXT_HELP), so for example,
       it shouldn't be permitted to have an OK and a Save button at the same time.

    The IDs supported by wxStdDialogButtonSizer are:
    wxID_OK
    wxID_YES
    wxID_SAVE
    wxID_APPLY
    wxID_NO
    wxID_CANCEL
    wxID_HELP
    wxID_CONTEXT_HELP
