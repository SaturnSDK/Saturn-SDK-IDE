/** \brief Class for wxsRichTextStyleListCtrl widget
 *	\note If you set the control or a style sheet for this control in wxSmith you must ensure that it has been declared
 *	beforehand, or use SetRichTextCtrl() and SetStyleSheet(). If set via wxSmith, these functions are called late enough
 *	that you can using the style sheet declared for wxRichTextStyleOrganiserDialog. Alternatively, you could declare one
 *	manually before the wxSmith-managed code block.
