1) : [DONE!] you should use the macro _ instead of wxT in ProjectOptions.cpp
     at lines 164, 180, 242, 247, 263, 268 to allow the translation
     of the strings in the result window.
2) : when there are no results, nothing is displayed. It could be nice
     to have a windows containing the string "No results" or something
     more elaborated.
3) : when a result window has been displayed, could it be possible to
     restart directly the plugin (for example with a specific button),
     because if I want to try an other set of options I have to go trough
     the menus Extensions/Project Options.
4) : when you delete an option, it could be nice to have a summary in the
     result window to know exactly where the option has been deleted.
5) : the string menu "Search for NOT w/ option" is not very clear for me.
     I think that it's to display the results with and without this option
     and only for compiler options (because I don't see any difference
     with link options).

1. [TOO LATE?!] please use lower case plus underscores to prevent any OS porting issues.
2. [DONE!] external dependencies are not needed here (I think), because C::B should
   detect them auto-magically.
3. [DONE!] the post build action should use devel/codeblocks instead of devel/CodeBlocks
   (I know we have to have two sets of projects).
4. [HUH?!] The code style needs fixing
5. [DONE!] You've named you dialog ProjectOptionsDlg which is the same as the
   ProjectOptionsDlg in src/src. This causes symbols collision on linux and thus a crash.
   You'll have to rename your dialog for now.
   Later we should begin using -fvisibility=hidden!
6. The results dialog should probably use a listctrl instead of textctrl
   (this will make the output a bit clearer)
6.1. When you switch to listctrl and it will be if you make double click on an item to
   open the build options dialog.
7. The results dialog should probably be an editor, allowing multiple instances

But it would be nice if it didn't disappear after a search is done. I would like to
hammer in multiple searches to make sure I got everything set correctly.

killerbot:
----------
[DONE!] result window can be bigger

MortenMacFly:
-------------

This plugin should allow to easily manipulate all important settings so that one can
easily switch between SDK's (being wxWidgets or anything else...).
This also includes:
[DONE!] compiler/linker folder manipulation
maybe even object folder,
[DONE!] Libraries
output folder

Jens:
-----
[DONE!] manipulate the "Custom variables" especially to make the wx30 projectfiles useful
        for wx-svn which is 3.1 and normally not build in standard path
