1. [TOO LATE?!] please use lower case plus underscores to prevent any OS porting issues.
2. [DONE!] external dependencies are not needed here (I think), because C::B should
   detect them auto-magically.
3. [DONE!] the post build action should use devel/codeblocks instead of devel/CodeBlocks
   (I know we have to have two sets of projects).
4. [HUH?!] The code style needs fixing
5. [DONE!] You've named you dialog ProjectOptionsDlg which is the same as the
   ProjectOptionsDlg in src/src. This causes symbols collision on linux and thus a crash.
   You'll have to rename your dialog for now.
   Later we should begin using -fvisibility=hidden!
6. The results dialog should probably use a listctrl instead of textctrl
   (this will make the output a bit clearer)
6.1. When you switch to listctrl and it will be if you make double click on an item to
   open the build options dialog.
7. The results dialog should probably be an editor, allowing multiple instances

But it would be nice if it didn't disappear after a search is done. I would like to
hammer in multiple searches to make sure I got everything set correctly.

result window can be bigger

Include directories, libraries and so on...
This plugin should allow to easily manipulate all important settings so that one can
easily switch between SDK's (being wxWidgets or anything else...).
This also includes compiler/linker folder manipulation, maybe even object folder,
output folder, lib folder...

Jens:
-----
manipulate the "Custom variables" especially to make the wx30 projectfiles useful
for wx-svn which is 3.1 and normally not build in standard path
