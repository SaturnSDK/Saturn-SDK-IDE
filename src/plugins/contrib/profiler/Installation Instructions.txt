Supossing %CODEBLOCKS% is the root of your Code::Blocks Installation...


Copy "CB Profiler\bin\CBProfiler.dll" to "%CODEBLOCKS%\share\CodeBlocks\plugins\"
Under Linux you need to compile the plugin yourself for now (Well, you'd have a .so instead of a dll)

Copy "CB Profiler\bin\cb_profiler.zip" to "%CODEBLOCKS%\share\CodeBlocks\"
Or similar under Linux

Notice the provided binaries are linked against wxWidgets 2.4.2 to work with the current v1.0-RC1.1 of Code::Blocks, so you'll have problems if using another version with your Code::Blocks Installation. If you run into such troubles, then you'll have to compile the plugin yourself to match the exact options of the wxwidgets binaries your Code::Blocks installation is using (e.g wxwidgets 2.6.1 or unicode support)
