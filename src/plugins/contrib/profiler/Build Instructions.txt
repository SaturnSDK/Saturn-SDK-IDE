Just open "cbprofiler.workspace". Then youll find a project inside. I havent had the chance to test this
under Linux (i.e my slack' box is broken), so I dont know if the provided workspace/project are valid under
it. In case they are not, then it might suffice with creating a "dummy" plugin project with the plugin
wizard and then adding manually all the *.cpp and *.h.

In any case, you should check the project build properties, and change the include/lib paths according
to your WxWidgets and C::B SDK/Full Sources paths.

The sources have been compiled with wxWidgets 2.4. Some little changes are needed to compile it with wxWidgets 2.6 (at least, uncomment the "#include <wx/arrstr.h>" lines).
