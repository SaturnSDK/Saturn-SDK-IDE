ToDo's by MortenMacFly:

...the easy ones:
- for the log: Optional: Leave out the files which were not modified.
- save bindings in a separate file, not into the global config
  (as it grows a lot otherwise)
- optional: open files, modify them (if needed) and leave them unsaved

...more complex ones:
- add reason for include as a comment just after the include (optional)
