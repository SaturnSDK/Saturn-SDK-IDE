ToDo's by MortenMacFly:

...the easy ones:
- detect existing forward decls
- detect spaces in includes, e.g. #include < wx/wx.h >
- add reason for include as a comment just after the include (optional)
- make the log also available in a report window for inspection/save
- for the log: Optional: Leave out the files which were not modified.
- save the UI settings (including selection of libs)
- optional: open modified files and leave them unsaved

...more complex ones:
- use RegEx for detection of includes, forward decls... in files
- an option to ingnore any existing includes
  (especially in header files to make forward decls more efficient)
