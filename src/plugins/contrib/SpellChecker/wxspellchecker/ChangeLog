2005-12-03 : SpellCheckEngineInterface should now use the correct character encoding for the selected dictionary

2005-11-25 : wxSpellChecker should now compile with Unicode support
             Replaced usage of wxMessageBox and wxPrintf with wxMessageOutput for better command-line support
             
2005-11-05 : Added back the ability to use the "affix-file" and "dict-file" options as an alternative to the "dictionary-path" and "language" options

2005-10-15 : Applied patches contributed by Julian SmarApplied patches contributed by Julian Smart
             Based on user feedback, removed option saving/loading from the spell check libraries.  This is best left in the application code
             Sample spell check engine option saving/loading code added to the demo application
             MySpell options changed from "affix-file" and "dict-file" to "dictionary-path" and "language" (making it easier to specify the dictionary path and let the user specify the language)
             SpellCheckEngineOption now supports relative paths
             Added SpellCheckEngineInterface::IsInitialized() function to check whether the engine was able to initialize with the options specified
             Fixed an issue where FILE and DIR options were accidentally changed to STRING options if changed on the options dialog
             Options dialog now sorts combo boxes
             PersonalDictionary file names can now be relative paths
             Added OpenPersonalDictionary function to MySpell and Aspell interfaces for setting the personal dictionary file name
             Changed compile system over to bakefiles
             The build targets were split out to aspell, myspell, and wxspellchecker (combined) so that you don't have to compile Aspell or MySpell if you don't use it
             
2005-07-01 : Verified that wxSpellChecker compiles with wxWidget 2.6.1 and Aspell 0.60.3
             Aspell and MySpell engines now verify that library directories exist at startup
             Fixed highlighted context for text less than 50 characters
             Applied patch contributed by Bryan Petty to work around a bug in the wxWidgets' string tokenizer

2005-03-20 : Changed makefiles to use the first wx-config in the path.
             (Aspell) Upgraded Aspell library to 0.60.2
             (wxWidgets) Upgraded to wxWidgets 2.5.4
             Fixed some segmentation faults when trying to use an unintialized Aspell engine
             wxWidgets sample now disables unintialized spell check engines

2004-05-13 : Moved the DictionaryWizard into the tools directory to try and keep the library size down

2004-05-11 : Added DictionaryWizard to help download available dictionaries for the spell check engine

2004-04-11 : (Sample) Removed Outlook-like and Sentry-like dialog classes and made XML resource replacements.  The Mozilla-like dialog class was kept as an example of deriving from wxSpellCheckDialogInterface.
             Sample now allows directly presenting the personal dictionary dialog
             Sample now allows for saving the wxTextCtrl contents to a file

2004-04-11 : (Aspell) Aspell engine now uses the generic PersonalDictionary class.  This will probably change to Aspell's internal personal dictionary support if/when Aspell's API includes a way to remove words from the personal dictionary.

2004-04-09 : (MySpell) Added personal dictionary support to MySpell engine

2004-04-04 : (Options) The spell check engine options dialog now retrieves and sets user options

2004-04-01 : (ALL) MSVC project files added

2004-03-30 : (ALL) Added wxSpellChecker to the wxCode repository
