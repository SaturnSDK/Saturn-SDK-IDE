Description:
wxSpellChecker is an library that provides an API to use various spell checker
engines through wxWidgets classes or a C interface.  The developer should have
flexibility in the dialog design (using XML resources) and the spell checking
interface (only Aspell and Myspell are supported at this time).  For maximum
control, developers can derive dialog classes from wxSpellCheckDialogInterface
and create more customized dialogs.  Non-dialog based interfaces can be created
by deriving from the wxSpellCheckUserInterface directly.  Also support can be
added for more spell check engines as needed using the
wxSpellCheckEngineInterface base class.
