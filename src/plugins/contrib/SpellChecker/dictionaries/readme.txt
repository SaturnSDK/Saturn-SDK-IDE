This is a placeholder directory for dictionaries you want to use with the plugin.
Dictionaries for hunspell and MyThes can be downloaded from:
http://wiki.services.openoffice.org/wiki/Dictionaries
OOo 2.x files. OOo 3.x Extensions (.oxt) are zip'ed archives containing these files.
During the build process, the dictionaries will be copied to the right place.
Notice that we do not provide any dictionaries due to limiting the bandwidth.
