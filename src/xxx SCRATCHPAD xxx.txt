Layout file
----------
1. Describes what subdirectory refers to which human-readable family name
2. Describes what file types go through which stages in each family (if a particular compiler does not implement a stage,
   - for example 'precompile' - then that stage shall be silently ignored).



Behaviours
-----------
Behaviours can only be either boolean values (on, off, explicitely off) or choices.

Booleans: The value "off" refers more correctly to "not on in this context", but may still result being "on" due to inheritance. Contrarily, "explicitely off" does not honour any ancestors.
Choices: Choices are declared in behaviours.xml (user visible text and identifiers), and must either be not implemented at all, or implemented
exactly like they were declared in the compiler file (map identifiers to commandline options).


Properties
----------
Properties can be booleans, choices, integers, strings, and string arrays. As a special case of strings, filenames and pathnames are allowed,
these are implemented as strings but can be declared as being absolute or relative (and are normalized accordingly),
also they may offer a more sophisticated GUI.



Compiler file format
------------------

Tools:
- define the tool 
   - search locations
       The special form 'alias:name' means "same as tool 'name'".
   - file name
       The special form 'alias:name' means "same as tool 'name'". If an alias for the *executable* is given, no path is needed.
   - challenge and response (there may be several responses, all must match
Only names that have been declared earlier in the document can be referenced as alias (no, I am not going to implement recursive aliasing...).


Stages:
- preprocess
- precompile
- compile
- link

<stage run="perfile|pertarget">
The link stage usually runs per target, all others usually run per file.
Default: per file.


For each stage:
- command: the complete commandline needed to run a stage
  A command may be assigned a mode. This is to honour the different modes of invokation, for example
  to build a static or dynamic library, or to generate precompiled headers alongside the header or in another folder.
  If the application provides a mode when querying the commandline, only a matching commandline is returned.
  If no mode is provided, the first command found is returned (which should be the only one anyway).
- implement behaviours: A compiler may either not implement a behaviour (in that case, no configuration is available
  for that compiler, and the behaviour is completely ignored) or it must implement it exactly as declared in behaviours.xml
- implement properties:
- definitions: Commandline flags which the build system needs apart from options, for example to add a path to a tool or to define
  a constant for the tool used in this stage
- <error> and <warning> provide a regex to parse output for one specific error condition or warning
- There may be several of each, referring to different conditions
- Each regex only operates inside the stage defined by the context attribute (different from the current implementation!)
