The setup source file provided here is for use with the InnoSetup compiler (http://www.jrsoftware.org). NOTE: InnoSetup does not allow files from system dirs (like windows/system32) to be added to the setup (for security reasons). So you must copy wxmsw241.dll and mingwm10.dll from windows/system32 to this directory, in order for setup to compile.

More setup compilers might be added at a later time.
