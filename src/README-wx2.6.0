Officialy, Code::Blocks uses wxWidgets-2.6.

HOWTO build wxWidgets-2.6 for use with Code::Blocks
------------------------------------------------------
This process requires that you have MinGW installed. MSYS is *not* needed.
Download and decompress the wxWidgets-2.6.1 source distribution. For the rest of this small HOWTO, C:\wx2.6.1 will be assumed to be the directory wxWidgets-2.6.1 exists in.
If you decompress wxWidgets in a different dir, adjust the instructions appropriately.

Open a command prompt and type the following:

cd C:\wx2.6.1\build\msw
mingw32-make -f makefile.gcc BUILD=release SHARED=1 MONOLITHIC=1 USE_XRC=1 UNICODE=0 VENDOR=cb CFG=NonUnicode
cd ..\..\contrib\build\stc
mingw32-make -f makefile.gcc BUILD=release SHARED=1 MONOLITHIC=1 USE_XRC=1 UNICODE=0 VENDOR=cb CFG=NonUnicode

If all has gone well, the necessary libs and DLLs will exist in C:\wx2.6.1\lib\gcc_dllNonUnicode.
Copy the DLLs somewhere in your path (c:\windows\system32 is a good choice).
Launch Code::Blocks and click on "Settings->Compiler".
Switch to the "Custom variables" page and add the following variables:
WX_DIR=c:\wx2.6.1
WX_CFG=NonUnicode

Open CodeBlocks-wx2.6.0.cbp with Code::Blocks and click "Compile->Compile".
When it finishes, don't forget to run update.bat.
That's it!

REMARKS:
- If all goes well and you build Code::Blocks with wx2.6, but when you launch it it crashes, delete all plugins and hit "Compile" again (it will only link the plugins).
- Different object files output dirs are used for building Code::Blocks with wx2.6.0, so you can have Code::Blocks work with either wxWidgets version (2.4.2 or 2.6) independently.

If you have any problems, post them in the Development forum at http://www.codeblocks.org/index.php?name=PNphpBB2&file=viewforum&f=7

Yiannis.
