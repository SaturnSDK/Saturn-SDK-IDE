Bugs that need immediate attention:
-----------------------------------
* File properties crashes when no compiler plugins loaded:
When there are no compiler plugins installed, selecting the properties of any project files causes an assertion failure + a crash, because ProjectFile::SetObjName is called, and this line:
"fname.SetExt(CompilerFactory::Compilers[project->GetCompilerIndex()]->GetSwitches().objectExtension);"
relies on having compilers in the compilers array, which is actually empty.
