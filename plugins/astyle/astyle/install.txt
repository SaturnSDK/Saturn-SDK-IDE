Welcome to Artistic Style!


Download Versions:
===================

astyle_x.y_linux.tar.gz is the Linux version of astyle.  It contains 
the source code, documentation, and a makefile for compiling the
source code with GCC.  Refer to the Linux Version compile 
instructions below.  Refer to the documentation for instructions on
executing AStyle.exe.  GCC will automatically allow the use of 
wildcards (such as "*.cpp") during execution.

AStyle_x.y_windows.zip is the Windows version of astyle.  It
contains the source code, documentation, and an executable,
AStyle.exe.  Refer to the documentation for instructions on
executing AStyle.exe.  It has been compiled to allow the use 
of wildcards (such as "*.cpp") during execution.


Linux Version:
===================
To compile under linux/unix/cygwin:
-----------------------------------

You must first have GCC (3.1 or better) installed.  Other C++ 
compilers may work but will require tweaking the make file.

To build astyle, use the makefile located in the astyle/src directory:
	cd astyle/src
	make
	cd ../..
    
To clean the object files:
	make clean
    
The astyle executable will be in the astyle/src directory.    

To use a compiler other than g++ set the variable CC (e.g.):
    make CC=g++-4.0
To compile with debug information define DEBUG (e.g.):
    make DEBUG=1

The Linux GCC compiler will automatically allow the use of wildcards 
(such as "*.cpp") during execution.


Windows Version:
===================
Precompiled executable:
-----------------------
In addition to the sources the Windows version contains, 
an astyle executable (AStyle.exe).

The executable is compiled to allow wildcard use during execution.

To compile under Windows:
-------------------------

1. Create a project under Visual C++ (or another compiler) and add
   all the .cpp and .h files.
   
2. In order to use wildcards (such as "*.cpp") during execution:
   With Visual C++, insert "setargv.obj" to the list of linker additional 
   dependencies.
   With the MinGW build of the GCC compiler, the use of wildcards is 
   automatic.
   With other compilers I don't know of a way to allow wildcards.  If 
   anyone knows, I would appreciate the information.

3. Compile...
   It is usually best to optimize the program for speed.


Enjoy!
