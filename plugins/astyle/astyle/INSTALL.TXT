Welcome to Artistic Style!


Precompiled STABLE versions:
----------------------------
These contain, in addition to the sources, an astyle executable.

astyle_x.y.z_glibc.tar.gz contains the file astyle .
astyle_x.y.z_win32.zip contains file astyle.exe .

To use these files, simply add them to you PATH system variable
(or copy them to a directory that is included in your PATH variable)
and run from the console.


Source version:
===============
To compile under linux/unix/cygwin:
-----------------------------------


1. The file compiler_defines.h contains several options regarding the
   compiler to be used.

   - if your compiler does not recognize "namespace"s, then COMMENT OUT

     the line:
     #define USES_NAMESPACE

2. After the above is set, type 'make'.
   This should create an executable file called 'astyle'.


To compile under Win95/NT:
--------------------------

1. Create a project under Visual C++ (or another compiler) and import
   all the .cpp and .h files.
2. In order to have Artistic Style expand wildcards (such as "*.cpp"),
   insert "setargv.obj" to the list of files to link Artistic-Style
   to. This at least works under Visual C++. I do not know if it works
   under other compilers. (Nat, thanks for the info on wildcard expanding!)
3. Compile...


Enjoy!
